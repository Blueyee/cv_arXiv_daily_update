001__ Self-Supervised Exploration via Disagreement__arXiv:1906.04161
Author: Deepak Pathak
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04161
 Abstract: Efficient exploration is a long-standing problem in sensorimotor learning. Major advances have been demonstrated in noise-free, non-stochastic domains such as video games and simulation. However, most of these formulations either get stuck in environments with stochastic dynamics or are too inefficient to be scalable to real robotics setups. In this paper, we propose a formulation for exploration inspired by the work in active learning literature. Specifically, we train an ensemble of dynamics models and incentivize the agent to explore such that the disagreement of those ensembles is maximized. This allows the agent to learn skills by exploring in a self-supervised manner without any external reward. Notably, we further leverage the disagreement objective to optimize the agent's policy in a differentiable manner, without using reinforcement learning, which results in a sample-efficient exploration. We demonstrate the efficacy of this formulation across a variety of benchmark environments including stochastic-Atari, Mujoco and Unity. Finally, we implement our differentiable exploration on a real robot which learns to interact with objects completely from scratch. Project videos and code are at this https URL 

002__ Global optimization of dielectric metasurfaces using a physics-driven  neural network__arXiv:1906.04157
Author: Jiaqi Jiang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04157
 Abstract: We present a global optimizer, based on a generative neural network, which can output highly efficient topology-optimized metasurfaces operating across a range of parameters. A key feature of the network is that it initially generates a distribution of devices that broadly samples the design space, and then shifts and refines this distribution towards favorable design space regions over the course of optimization. Training is performed by calculating the forward and adjoint electromagnetic simulations of outputted devices and using the subsequent efficiency gradients for backpropagation. With metagratings operating across a range of wavelengths and angles as a model system, we show that devices produced from the trained generative network have efficiencies comparable to or better than the best devices produced by adjoint-based topology optimization, while requiring less computational cost. Our reframing of adjoint-based optimization to the training of a generative neural network applies generally to physical systems that can utilize gradients to improve performance. error here, check on website.

004__ Commuting Conditional GANs for Robust Multi-Modal Fusion__arXiv:1906.04115
Author: Siddharth Roheda
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04115
 Abstract: This paper presents a data driven approach to multi-modal fusion, where optimal features for each sensor are selected from a common hidden space between the different modalities. The existence of such a hidden space is then used in order to detect damaged sensors and safeguard the performance of the system. Experimental results show that such an approach can make the system robust against noisy/damaged sensors, without requiring human intervention to inform the system about the damage. 

005__ Fisher-guided Block Substitution for Network Compression__arXiv:1906.04113
Author: Jack Turner
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04113
 Abstract: The desire to run neural networks on low-capacity edge devices has led to the development of a wealth of compression techniques. Moonshine is a simple and powerful example of this: one takes a large pre-trained network and substitutes each of its convolutional blocks with a selected cheap alternative block, then distills the resultant network with the original. However, not all blocks are created equally; for a required parameter budget there may exist a potent combination of many different cheap blocks. In this work, we find these by developing BlockSwap: an algorithm for choosing networks with interleaved block types by passing a single minibatch of training data through randomly initialised networks and gauging their Fisher potential. We show that block-wise cheapening yields more accurate networks than single block-type networks across a spectrum of parameter budgets. Code is available at this https URL 

006__ Quantifying Layerwise Information Discarding of Neural Networks__arXiv:1906.04109
Author: Haotian Ma
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04109
 Abstract: This paper presents a method to explain how input information is discarded through intermediate layers of a neural network during the forward propagation, in order to quantify and diagnose knowledge representations of pre-trained deep neural networks. We define two types of entropy-based metrics, i.e., the strict information discarding and the reconstruction uncertainty, which measure input information of a specific layer from two perspectives. We develop a method to enable efficient computation of such entropy-based metrics. Our method can be broadly applied to various neural networks and enable comprehensive comparisons between different layers of different networks. Preliminary experiments have shown the effectiveness of our metrics in analyzing benchmark networks and explaining existing deep-learning techniques. 

007__ Stretching the Effectiveness of MLE from Accuracy to Bias for Pairwise  Comparisons__arXiv:1906.04066
Author: Jingyan Wang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04066
 Abstract: A number of applications (e.g., AI bot tournaments, sports, peer grading, crowdsourcing) use pairwise comparison data and the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model to evaluate a given collection of items (e.g., bots, teams, students, search results). Past work has shown that under the BTL model, the widely-used maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) is minimax-optimal in estimating the item parameters, in terms of the mean squared error. However, another important desideratum for designing estimators is fairness. In this work, we consider fairness modeled by the notion of bias in statistics. We show that the MLE incurs a suboptimal rate in terms of bias. We then propose a simple modification to the MLE, which "stretches" the bounding box of the maximum-likelihood optimizer by a small constant factor from the underlying ground truth domain. We show that this simple modification leads to an improved rate in bias, while maintaining minimax-optimality in the mean squared error. In this manner, our proposed class of estimators provably improves fairness represented by bias without loss in accuracy. 

008__ Joint Semantic Domain Alignment and Target Classifier Learning for  Unsupervised Domain Adaptation__arXiv:1906.04053
Author: Dong-Dong Chen
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04053
 Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation aims to transfer the classifier learned from the source domain to the target domain in an unsupervised manner. With the help of target pseudo-labels, aligning class-level distributions and learning the classifier in the target domain are two widely used objectives. Existing methods often separately optimize these two individual objectives, which makes them suffer from the neglect of the other. However, optimizing these two aspects together is not trivial. To alleviate the above issues, we propose a novel method that jointly optimizes semantic domain alignment and target classifier learning in a holistic way. The joint optimization mechanism can not only eliminate their weaknesses but also complement their strengths. The theoretical analysis also verifies the favor of the joint optimization mechanism. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method yields the best performance in comparison with the state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods. 

009__ A Generalized Cost-sensitive Neural Network Approach for  Imbalanced Classification__arXiv:1906.04026
Author: Xiangrui Li
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04026
 Abstract: Classification on imbalanced datasets is a challenging task in real-world applications. Training conventional classification algorithms directly by minimizing classification error in this scenario can compromise model performance for minority class while optimizing performance for majority class. Traditional approaches to the imbalance problem include re-sampling and cost-sensitive methods. In this paper, we propose a neural network model with novel loss function, CRCEN, for imbalanced classification. Based on the weighted version of cross entropy loss, we provide a theoretical relation for model predicted probability, imbalance ratio and the weighting mechanism. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model, CRCEN is tested on several benchmark datasets and compared with baseline models. 

010__ Visual Backpropagation__arXiv:1906.04011
Author: Roy S. Freedman
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04011
 Abstract: We show how a declarative functional programming specification of backpropagation yields a visual and transparent implementation within spreadsheets. We call our method Visual Backpropagation. This backpropagation implementation exploits array worksheet formulas, manual calculation, and has a sequential order of computation similar to the processing of a systolic array. The implementation uses no hidden macros nor user-defined functions; there are no loops, assignment statements, or links to any procedural programs written in conventional languages. As an illustration, we compare a Visual Backpropagation solution to a Tensorflow (Python) solution on a standard regression problem. 

011__ Emphasizing Recent Experience without  Forgetting the Past__arXiv:1906.04009
Author: Che Wang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04009
 Abstract: Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) is an off-policy actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm based on maximum entropy reinforcement learning. By combining off-policy updates with an actor-critic formulation, SAC achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of continuous-action benchmark tasks, outperforming prior on-policy and off-policy methods. The off-policy method employed by SAC samples data uniformly from past experience when performing parameter updates. We propose Emphasizing Recent Experience (ERE), a simple but powerful off-policy sampling technique, which emphasizes recently observed data while not forgetting the past. The ERE algorithm samples more aggressively from recent experience, and also orders the updates to ensure that updates from old data do not overwrite updates from new data. We compare vanilla SAC and SAC+ERE, and show that ERE is more sample efficient than vanilla SAC for continuous-action Mujoco tasks. We also consider combining SAC with Priority Experience Replay (PER), a scheme originally proposed for deep Q-learning which prioritizes the data based on temporal-difference (TD) error. We show that SAC+PER can marginally improve the sample efficiency performance of SAC, but much less so than SAC+ERE. Finally, we propose an algorithm which integrates ERE and PER and show that this hybrid algorithm can give the best results for some of the Mujoco tasks. 

012__ Errors-in-variables Modeling of Personalized Treatment-Response  Trajectories__arXiv:1906.03989
Author: Guangyi Zhang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03989
 Abstract: Estimating the effect of a treatment on a given outcome, conditioned on a vector of covariates, is central in many applications. However, learning the impact of a treatment on a continuous temporal response, when the covariates suffer extensively from measurement error and even the timing of the treatments is uncertain, has not been addressed. We introduce a novel data-driven method that can estimate treatment-response trajectories in this challenging scenario. We model personalized treatment-response curves as a combination of parametric response functions, hierarchically sharing information across individuals, and a sparse Gaussian process for the baseline trend. Importantly, our model considers measurement error not only in treatment covariates, but also in treatment times, a problem which arises in practice for example when treatment information is based on self-reporting. In a challenging and timely problem of estimating the impact of diet on continuous blood glucose measurements, our model leads to significant improvements in estimation accuracy and prediction. 

013__ Unit Impulse Response as an Explainer of Redundancy in a Deep  Convolutional Neural Network__arXiv:1906.03986
Author: Rachana Sathish
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03986
 Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are generally designed with a heuristic initialization of network architecture and trained for a certain task. This often leads to overparametrization after learning and induces redundancy in the information flow paths within the network. This robustness and reliability is at the increased cost of redundant computations. Several methods have been proposed which leverage metrics that quantify the redundancy in each layer. However, layer-wise evaluation in these methods disregards the long-range redundancy which exists across depth on account of the distributed nature of the features learned by the model. In this paper, we propose (i) a mechanism to empirically demonstrate the robustness in performance of a CNN on account of redundancy across its depth, (ii) a method to identify the systemic redundancy in response of a CNN across depth using the understanding of unit impulse response, we subsequently demonstrate use of these methods to interpret redundancy in few networks as example. These techniques provide better insights into the internal dynamics of a CNN 

014__ Optimal Exploitation of Clustering and History Information in  Multi-Armed Bandit__arXiv:1906.03979
Author: Djallel Bouneffouf
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03979
 Abstract: We consider the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem and the contextual bandit problem with historical observations and pre-clustered arms. The historical observations can contain any number of instances for each arm, and the pre-clustering information is a fixed clustering of arms provided as part of the input. We develop a variety of algorithms which incorporate this offline information effectively during the online exploration phase and derive their regret bounds. In particular, we develop the META algorithm which effectively hedges between two other algorithms: one which uses both historical observations and clustering, and another which uses only the historical observations. The former outperforms the latter when the clustering quality is good, and vice-versa. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real world datasets on Warafin drug dosage and web server selection for latency minimization validate our theoretical insights and demonstrate that META is a robust strategy for optimally exploiting the pre-clustering information. 

015__ A Primal-Dual  Perspective__arXiv:1906.03972
Author: Lu Wang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03972
 Abstract: We study the problem of computing the minimum adversarial perturbation of the Nearest Neighbor (NN) classifiers. Previous attempts either conduct attacks on continuous approximations of NN models or search for the perturbation by some heuristic methods. In this paper, we propose the first algorithm that is able to compute the minimum adversarial perturbation. The main idea is to formulate the problem as a list of convex quadratic programming (QP) problems that can be efficiently solved by the proposed algorithms for 1-NN models. Furthermore, we show that dual solutions for these QP problems could give us a valid lower bound of the adversarial perturbation that can be used for formal robustness verification, giving us a nice view of attack/verification for NN models. For $K$-NN models with larger $K$, we show that the same formulation can help us efficiently compute the upper and lower bounds of the minimum adversarial perturbation, which can be used for attack and verification. 

016__ Autonomous Goal Exploration using Learned Goal Spaces for Visuomotor  Skill Acquisition in Robots__arXiv:1906.03967
Author: Adrien Laversanne-Finot
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03967
 Abstract: The automatic and efficient discovery of skills, without supervision, for long-living autonomous agents, remains a challenge of Artificial Intelligence. Intrinsically Motivated Goal Exploration Processes give learning agents a human-inspired mechanism to sequentially select goals to achieve. This approach gives a new perspective on the lifelong learning problem, with promising results on both simulated and real-world experiments. Until recently, those algorithms were restricted to domains with experimenter-knowledge, since the Goal Space used by the agents was built on engineered feature extractors. The recent advances of deep representation learning, enables new ways of designing those feature extractors, using directly the agent experience. Recent work has shown the potential of those methods on simple yet challenging simulated domains. In this paper, we present recent results showing the applicability of those principles on a real-world robotic setup, where a 6-joint robotic arm learns to manipulate a ball inside an arena, by choosing goals in a space learned from its past experience. 

017__ Topological Data Analysis of Time Series Data for B2B Customer  Relationshop Management__arXiv:1906.03956
Author: Rodrigo Rivera-Castro
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03956
 Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is a recent approach to analyze data sets from the perspective of their topological structure. Its use for time series data has been limited to the field of financial time series primarily and as a method for feature generation in machine learning applications. In this work, TDA is presented as a technique to gain additional understanding of the customers' loyalty for business-to-business customer relationship management. Increasing loyalty and strengthening relationships with key accounts remain an active topic of discussion both for researchers and managers. Using two public and two proprietary data sets of commercial data, this research shows that the technique enables analysts to better understand their customer base and identify prospective opportunities. In addition, the approach can be used as a clustering method to increase the accuracy of a predictive model for loyalty scoring. This work thus seeks to introduce TDA as a viable tool for data analysis to the quantitate marketing practitioner. 

018__ A Scalable Neural Networks Framework Towards Compact and Efficient  Models__arXiv:1906.03951
Author: Linfeng Zhang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03951
 Abstract: Remarkable achievements have been attained by deep neural networks in various applications. However, the increasing depth and width of such models also lead to explosive growth in both storage and computation, which has restricted the deployment of deep neural networks on resource-limited edge devices. To address this problem, we propose the so-called SCAN framework for networks training and inference, which is orthogonal and complementary to existing acceleration and compression methods. The proposed SCAN firstly divides neural networks into multiple sections according to their depth and constructs shallow classifiers upon the intermediate features of different sections. Moreover, attention modules and knowledge distillation are utilized to enhance the accuracy of shallow classifiers. Based on this architecture, we further propose a threshold controlled scalable inference mechanism to approach human-like sample-specific inference. Experimental results show that SCAN can be easily equipped on various neural networks without any adjustment on hyper-parameters or neural networks architectures, yielding significant performance gain on CIFAR100 and ImageNet. Codes will be released on github soon. 

019__ Domain-Specific Batch Normalization for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation__arXiv:1906.03950
Author: Woong-Gi Chang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03950
 Abstract: We propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation framework based on domain-specific batch normalization in deep neural networks. We aim to adapt to both domains by specializing batch normalization layers in convolutional neural networks while allowing them to share all other model parameters, which is realized by a two-stage algorithm. In the first stage, we estimate pseudo-labels for the examples in the target domain using an external unsupervised domain adaptation algorithm---for example, MSTN or CPUA---integrating the proposed domain-specific batch normalization. The second stage learns the final models using a multi-task classification loss for the source and target domains. Note that the two domains have separate batch normalization layers in both stages. Our framework can be easily incorporated into the domain adaptation techniques based on deep neural networks with batch normalization layers. We also present that our approach can be extended to the problem with multiple source domains. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets and achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy in the standard setting and the multi-source domain adaption scenario. 

020__ Death Prediction in Dota 2 using Deep Learning__arXiv:1906.03939
Author: Adam Katona
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03939
 Abstract: Esports have become major international sports with hundreds of millions of spectators. Esports games generate massive amounts of telemetry data. Using these to predict the outcome of esports matches has received considerable attention, but micro-predictions, which seek to predict events inside a match, is as yet unknown territory. Micro-predictions are however of perennial interest across esports commentators and audience, because they provide the ability to observe events that might otherwise be missed: esports games are highly complex with fast-moving action where the balance of a game can change in the span of seconds, and where events can happen in multiple areas of the playing field at the same time. Such events can happen rapidly, and it is easy for commentators and viewers alike to miss an event and only observe the following impact of events. In Dota 2, a player hero being killed by the opposing team is a key event of interest to commentators and audience. We present a deep learning network with shared weights which provides accurate death predictions within a five-second window. The network is trained on a vast selection of Dota 2 gameplay features and professional/semi-professional level match dataset. Even though death events are rare within a game (1\% of the data), the model achieves 0.377 precision with 0.725 recall on test data when prompted to predict which of any of the 10 players of either team will die within 5 seconds. An example of the system applied to a Dota 2 match is presented. This model enables real-time micro-predictions of kills in Dota 2, one of the most played esports titles in the world, giving commentators and viewers time to move their attention to these key events. 

021__ A Survey of Reinforcement Learning Informed by Natural Language__arXiv:1906.03926
Author: Jelena Luketina
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03926
 Abstract: To be successful in real-world tasks, Reinforcement Learning (RL) needs to exploit the compositional, relational, and hierarchical structure of the world, and learn to transfer it to the task at hand. Recent advances in representation learning for language make it possible to build models that acquire world knowledge from text corpora and integrate this knowledge into downstream decision making problems. We thus argue that the time is right to investigate a tight integration of natural language understanding into RL in particular. We survey the state of the field, including work on instruction following, text games, and learning from textual domain knowledge. Finally, we call for the development of new environments as well as further investigation into the potential uses of recent Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for such tasks. 

022__ Multi-objects Generation with Amortized Structural Regularization__arXiv:1906.03923
Author: Kun Xu
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03923
 Abstract: Deep generative models (DGMs) have shown promise in image generation. However, most of the existing work learn the model by simply optimizing a divergence between the marginal distributions of the model and the data, and often fail to capture the rich structures and relations in multi-object images. Human knowledge is a critical element to the success of DGMs to infer these structures. In this paper, we propose the amortized structural regularization (ASR) framework, which adopts the posterior regularization (PR) to embed human knowledge into DGMs via a set of structural constraints. We derive a lower bound of the regularized log-likelihood, which can be jointly optimized with respect to the generative model and recognition model efficiently. Empirical results show that ASR significantly outperforms the DGM baselines in terms of inference accuracy and sample quality. 

023__ Few-Shot Learning with Per-Sample Rich Supervision__arXiv:1906.03859
Author: Roman Visotsky
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03859
 Abstract: Learning with few samples is a major challenge for parameter-rich models like deep networks. In contrast, people learn complex new concepts even from very few examples, suggesting that the sample complexity of learning can often be reduced. Many approaches to few-shot learning build on transferring a representation from well-sampled classes, or using meta learning to favor architectures that can learn with few samples. Unfortunately, such approaches often struggle when learning in an online way or with non-stationary data streams. Here we describe a new approach to learn with fewer samples, by using additional information that is provided per sample. Specifically, we show how the sample complexity can be reduced by providing semantic information about the relevance of features per sample, like information about the presence of objects in a scene or confidence of detecting attributes in an image. We provide an improved generalization error bound for this case. We cast the problem of using per-sample feature relevance by using a new ellipsoid-margin loss, and develop an online algorithm that minimizes this loss effectively. Empirical evaluation on two machine vision benchmarks for scene classification and fine-grain bird classification demonstrate the benefits of this approach for few-shot learning. 

024__ Robustness Verification of Tree-based Models__arXiv:1906.03849
Author: Hongge Chen
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03849
 Abstract: We study the robustness verification problem for tree-based models, including decision trees, random forests (RFs) and gradient boosted decision trees (GBDTs). Formal robustness verification of decision tree ensembles involves finding the exact minimal adversarial perturbation or a guaranteed lower bound of it. Existing approaches find the minimal adversarial perturbation by a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which takes exponential time so is impractical for large ensembles. Although this verification problem is NP-complete in general, we give a more precise complexity characterization. We show that there is a simple linear time algorithm for verifying a single tree, and for tree ensembles, the verification problem can be cast as a max-clique problem on a multi-partite graph with bounded boxicity. For low dimensional problems when boxicity can be viewed as constant, this reformulation leads to a polynomial time algorithm. For general problems, by exploiting the boxicity of the graph, we develop an efficient multi-level verification algorithm that can give tight lower bounds on the robustness of decision tree ensembles, while allowing iterative improvement and any-time termination. OnRF/GBDT models trained on 10 datasets, our algorithm is hundreds of times faster than the previous approach that requires solving MILPs, and is able to give tight robustness verification bounds on large GBDTs with hundreds of deep trees. 

025__ Learning Fair Naive Bayes Classifiers by Discovering and Eliminating  Discrimination Patterns__arXiv:1906.03843
Author: YooJung Choi
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03843
 Abstract: As machine learning is increasingly used to make real-world decisions, recent research efforts aim to define and ensure fairness in algorithmic decision making. Existing methods often assume a fixed set of observable features to define individuals, but lack a discussion of certain features not being observed at test time. In this paper, we study fairness of naive Bayes classifiers, which allow partial observations. In particular, we introduce the notion of a discrimination pattern, which refers to an individual receiving different classifications depending on whether some sensitive attributes were observed. Then a model is considered fair if it has no such pattern. We propose an algorithm to discover and mine for discrimination patterns in a naive Bayes classifier, and show how to learn maximum-likelihood parameters subject to these fairness constraints. Our approach iteratively discovers and eliminates discrimination patterns until a fair model is learned. An empirical evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates that we can remove exponentially many discrimination patterns by only adding a small fraction of them as constraints. 

026__ Analyzing the Role of Model Uncertainty for Electronic Health Records__arXiv:1906.03842
Author: Michael W. Dusenberry
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03842
 Abstract: In medicine, both ethical and monetary costs of incorrect predictions can be significant, and the complexity of the problems often necessitates increasingly complex models. Recent work has shown that changing just the random seed is enough for otherwise well-tuned deep neural networks to vary in their individual predicted probabilities. In light of this, we investigate the role of model uncertainty methods in the medical domain. Using RNN ensembles and various Bayesian RNNs, we show that population-level metrics, such as AUC-PR, AUC-ROC, log-likelihood, and calibration error, do not capture model uncertainty. Meanwhile, the presence of significant variability in patient-specific predictions and optimal decisions motivates the need for capturing model uncertainty. Understanding the uncertainty for individual patients is an area with clear clinical impact, such as determining when a model decision is likely to be brittle. We further show that RNNs with only Bayesian embeddings can be a more efficient way to capture model uncertainty compared to ensembles, and we analyze how model uncertainty is impacted across individual input features and patient subgroups. 

027__ Learning Cross-Language API Mappings with Little Knowledge__arXiv:1906.03835
Author: Nghi D. Q. Bui
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03835
 Abstract: To save manual effort, developers often translate programs from one programming language to another, instead of implementing it from scratch. Translating application program interfaces (APIs) used in one language to functionally equivalent ones available in another language is an important aspect of program translation. Existing approaches facilitate the translation by automatically identifying the API mappings across programming languages. However, all these approaches still require large amount of manual effort in preparing parallel program corpora, ranging from pairs of APIs, to manually identified code in different languages that are considered as functionally equivalent. To minimize the manual effort in identifying parallel program corpora and API mappings, this paper aims at an automated approach to map APIs across languages with much less knowledge a priori needed than other existing approaches. The approach is based on an realization of the notion of domain adaption combined with code embedding, which can better align two vector spaces: taking as input large sets of programs, our approach first generates numeric vector representations of the programs, especially the APIs used in each language, and it adapts generative adversarial networks (GAN) to align the vectors from the spaces of two languages. For a better alignment, we initialize the GAN with parameters derived from optional API mapping seeds that can be identified accurately with a simple automatic signature-based matching heuristic. Then the cross-language API mappings can be identified via nearest-neighbors queries in the aligned vector spaces. 

028__  Convergence, Implicit Regularization, and Generalization__arXiv:1906.03830
Author: Navid Azizan
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03830
 Abstract: Most modern learning problems are highly overparameterized, meaning that there are many more parameters than the number of training data points, and as a result, the training loss may have infinitely many global minima (parameter vectors that perfectly interpolate the training data). Therefore, it is important to understand which interpolating solutions we converge to, how they depend on the initialization point and the learning algorithm, and whether they lead to different generalization performances. In this paper, we study these questions for the family of stochastic mirror descent (SMD) algorithms, of which the popular stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a special case. Our contributions are both theoretical and experimental. On the theory side, we show that in the overparameterized nonlinear setting, if the initialization is close enough to the manifold of global minima (something that comes for free in the highly overparameterized case), SMD with sufficiently small step size converges to a global minimum that is approximately the closest one in Bregman divergence. On the experimental side, our extensive experiments on standard datasets and models, using various initializations, various mirror descents, and various Bregman divergences, consistently confirms that this phenomenon happens in deep learning. Our experiments further indicate that there is a clear difference in the generalization performance of the solutions obtained by different SMD algorithms. Experimenting on a standard image dataset and network architecture with SMD with different kinds of implicit regularization, $\ell_1$ to encourage sparsity, $\ell_2$ yielding SGD, and $\ell_{10}$ to discourage large components in the parameter vector, consistently and definitively shows that $\ell_{10}$-SMD has better generalization performance than SGD, which in turn has better generalization performance than $\ell_1$-SMD. 

029__ Effective Model Compression for ResNets via Static  Layer Pruning and Retraining__arXiv:1906.03826
Author: Yasutoshi Ida
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03826
 Abstract: Residual Networks with convolutional layers are widely used in the field of machine learning. Since they effectively extract features from input data by stacking multiple layers, they can achieve high accuracy in many applications. However, the stacking of many layers raises their computation costs. To address this problem, we propose Network Implosion, it erases multiple layers from Residual Networks without degrading accuracy. Our key idea is to introduce a priority term that identifies the importance of a layer; we can select unimportant layers according to the priority and erase them after the training. In addition, we retrain the networks to avoid critical drops in accuracy after layer erasure. A theoretical assessment reveals that our erasure and retraining scheme can erase layers without accuracy drop, and achieve higher accuracy than is possible with training from scratch. Our experiments show that Network Implosion can, for classification on Cifar-10/100 and ImageNet, reduce the number of layers by 24.00 to 42.86 percent without any drop in accuracy. 

030__ A Neural  Translation Approach__arXiv:1906.03822
Author: Gyeong-In Yu
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03822
 Abstract: Classical Machine Learning (ML) pipelines often comprise of multiple ML models where models, within a pipeline, are trained in isolation. Conversely, when training neural network models, layers composing the neural models are simultaneously trained using backpropagation. We argue that the isolated training scheme of ML pipelines is sub-optimal, since it cannot jointly optimize multiple components. To this end, we propose a framework that translates a pre-trained ML pipeline into a neural network and fine-tunes the ML models within the pipeline jointly using backpropagation. Our experiments show that fine-tuning of the translated pipelines is a promising technique able to increase the final accuracy. 

031__ Time-Series Anomaly Detection Service at Microsoft__arXiv:1906.03821
Author: Hansheng Ren
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03821
 Abstract: Large companies need to monitor various metrics (for example, Page Views and Revenue) of their applications and services in real time. At Microsoft, we develop a time-series anomaly detection service which helps customers to monitor the time-series continuously and alert for potential incidents on time. In this paper, we introduce the pipeline and algorithm of our anomaly detection service, which is designed to be accurate, efficient and general. The pipeline consists of three major modules, including data ingestion, experimentation platform and online compute. To tackle the problem of time-series anomaly detection, we propose a novel algorithm based on Spectral Residual (SR) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Our work is the first attempt to borrow the SR model from visual saliency detection domain to time-series anomaly detection. Moreover, we innovatively combine SR and CNN together to improve the performance of SR model. Our approach achieves superior experimental results compared with state-of-the-art baselines on both public datasets and Microsoft production data. 

032__ A Closed-Form Learned Pooling for Deep Classification Networks__arXiv:1906.03808
Author: Vighnesh Birodkar
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03808
 Abstract: In modern computer vision tasks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are indispensable for image classification tasks due to their efficiency and effectiveness. Part of their superiority compared to other architectures, comes from the fact that a single, local filter is shared across the entire image. However, there are scenarios where we may need to treat spatial locations in non-uniform manner. We see this in nature when considering how humans have evolved foveation to process different areas in their field of vision with varying levels of detail. In this paper we propose a way to enable CNNs to learn different pooling weights for each pixel location. We do so by introducing an extended definition of a pooling operator. This operator can learn a strict super-set of what can be learned by average pooling or convolutions. It has the benefit of being shared across feature maps and can be encouraged to be local or diffuse depending on the data. We show that for fixed network weights, our pooling operator can be computed in closed-form by spectral decomposition of matrices associated with class separability. Through experiments, we show that this operator benefits generalization for ResNets and CNNs on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN datasets and improves robustness to geometric corruptions and perturbations on the CIFAR-10-C and CIFAR-10-P test sets. 

033__ Improving Neural Language Modeling via Adversarial Training__arXiv:1906.03805
Author: Dilin Wang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03805
 Abstract: Recently, substantial progress has been made in language modeling by using deep neural networks. However, in practice, large scale neural language models have been shown to be prone to overfitting. In this paper, we present a simple yet highly effective adversarial training mechanism for regularizing neural language models. The idea is to introduce adversarial noise to the output embedding layer while training the models. We show that the optimal adversarial noise yields a simple closed-form solution, thus allowing us to develop a simple and time efficient algorithm. Theoretically, we show that our adversarial mechanism effectively encourages the diversity of the embedding vectors, helping to increase the robustness of models. Empirically, we show that our method improves on the single model state-of-the-art results for language modeling on Penn Treebank (PTB) and Wikitext-2, achieving test perplexity scores of 46.01 and 38.07, respectively. When applied to machine translation, our method improves over various transformer-based translation baselines in BLEU scores on the WMT14 English-German and IWSLT14 German-English tasks. 

034__ On the Optimality of Sparse Model-Based Planning for Markov Decision  Processes__arXiv:1906.03804
Author: Alekh Agarwal
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03804
 Abstract: This work considers the sample complexity of obtaining an $\epsilon$-optimal policy in a discounted Markov Decision Process (MDP), given only access to a generative model. In this model, the learner accesses the underlying transition model via a sampling oracle that provides a sample of the next state, when given any state-action pair as input. In this work, we study the effectiveness of the most natural plug-in approach to model-based planning: we build the maximum likelihood estimate of the transition model in the MDP from observations and then find an optimal policy in this empirical MDP. We ask arguably the most basic and unresolved question in model-based planning: is the na\"ive "plug-in" approach, non-asymptotically, minimax optimal in the quality of the policy it finds, given a fixed sample size? With access to a generative model, we resolve this question in the strongest possible sense: our main result shows that \emph{any} high accuracy solution in the plug-in model constructed with $N$ samples, provides an $\epsilon$-optimal policy in the true underlying MDP. In comparison, all prior (non-asymptotically) minimax optimal results use model-free approaches, such as the Variance Reduced Q-value iteration algorithm (Sidford et al 2018), while the best known model-based results (e.g. Azar et al 2013) require larger sample sample sizes in their dependence on the planning horizon or the state space. Notably, we show that the model-based approach allows the use of \emph{any} efficient planning algorithm in the empirical MDP, which simplifies the algorithm design as this approach does not tie the algorithm to the sampling procedure. The core of our analysis is a novel "absorbing MDP" construction to address the statistical dependency issues that arise in the analysis of model-based planning approaches, a construction which may be helpful more generally. 

035__ Deep Spatio-Temporal Neural Networks for Click-Through Rate Prediction__arXiv:1906.03776
Author: Wentao Ouyang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03776
 Abstract: Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is a critical task in online advertising systems. A large body of research considers each ad independently, but ignores its relationship to other ads that may impact the CTR. In this paper, we investigate various types of auxiliary ads for improving the CTR prediction of the target ad. In particular, we explore auxiliary ads from two viewpoints: one is from the spatial domain, where we consider the contextual ads shown above the target ad on the same page; the other is from the temporal domain, where we consider historically clicked and unclicked ads of the user. The intuitions are that ads shown together may influence each other, clicked ads reflect a user's preferences, and unclicked ads may indicate what a user dislikes to certain extent. In order to effectively utilize these auxiliary data, we propose the Deep Spatio-Temporal neural Networks (DSTNs) for CTR prediction. Our model is able to learn the interactions between each type of auxiliary data and the target ad, to emphasize more important hidden information, and to fuse heterogeneous data in a unified framework. Offline experiments on one public dataset and two industrial datasets show that DSTNs outperform several state-of-the-art methods for CTR prediction. We have deployed the best-performing DSTN in Shenma Search, which is the second largest search engine in China. The A/B test results show that the online CTR is also significantly improved compared to our last serving model.

It provides the same classification accuracy as PCs and laptops, while doing so with acceptable processing speed and consuming negligible battery life. With its ability to provide easy-to-use data-mining on a phone-size screen, DataLearner is a new portable, self-contained data-mining tool for remote, personalised and learning applications alike. DataLearner features four elements - this paper, the app available on Google Play, the GPL3-licensed source code on GitHub and a short video on YouTube. 

037__ A Huber Loss with a Combined First and Second Order  Difference Regularization for Time Series Trend Filtering__arXiv:1906.03751
Author: Qingsong Wen
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03751
 Abstract: Extracting the underlying trend signal is a crucial step to facilitate time series analysis like forecasting and anomaly detection. Besides noise signal, time series can contain not only outliers but also abrupt trend changes in real-world scenarios. To deal with these challenges, we propose a robust trend filtering algorithm based on robust statistics and sparse learning. Specifically, we adopt the Huber loss to suppress outliers, and utilize a combination of the first order and second order difference on the trend component as regularization to capture both slow and abrupt trend changes. Furthermore, an efficient method is designed to solve the proposed robust trend filtering based on majorization minimization (MM) and alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We compared our proposed robust trend filter with other nine state-of-the-art trend filtering algorithms on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The experiments demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing methods. 

038__ Attacking Graph Convolutional Networks via Rewiring__arXiv:1906.03750
Author: Yao Ma
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03750
 Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have boosted the performance of many graph related tasks such as node classification and graph classification. Recent researches show that graph neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which deliberately add carefully created unnoticeable perturbation to the graph structure. The perturbation is usually created by adding/deleting a few edges, which might be noticeable even when the number of edges modified is small. In this paper, we propose a graph rewiring operation which affects the graph in a less noticeable way compared to adding/deleting edges. We then use reinforcement learning to learn the attack strategy based on the proposed rewiring operation. Experiments on real world graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. To understand the proposed framework, we further analyze how its generated perturbation to the graph structure affects the output of the target model. 

039__ Improved Adversarial Robustness via Logit Regularization Methods__arXiv:1906.03749
Author: Cecilia Summers
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03749
 Abstract: While great progress has been made at making neural networks effective across a wide range of visual tasks, most models are surprisingly vulnerable. This frailness takes the form of small, carefully chosen perturbations of their input, known as adversarial examples, which represent a security threat for learned vision models in the wild -- a threat which should be responsibly defended against in safety-critical applications of computer vision. In this paper, we advocate for and experimentally investigate the use of a family of logit regularization techniques as an adversarial defense, which can be used in conjunction with other methods for creating adversarial robustness at little to no marginal cost. We also demonstrate that much of the effectiveness of one recent adversarial defense mechanism can in fact be attributed to logit regularization, and show how to improve its defense against both white-box and black-box attacks, in the process creating a stronger black-box attack against PGD-based models. We validate our methods on three datasets and include results on both gradient-free attacks and strong gradient-based iterative attacks with as many as 1,000 steps. 

040__ Generative Continual Concept Learning__arXiv:1906.03744
Author: Mohammad Rostami
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03744
 Abstract: After learning a concept, humans are also able to continually generalize their learned concepts to new domains by observing only a few labeled instances without any interference with the past learned knowledge. In contrast, learning concepts efficiently in a continual learning setting remains an open challenge for current Artificial Intelligence algorithms as persistent model retraining is necessary. Inspired by the Parallel Distributed Processing learning and the Complementary Learning Systems theories, we develop a computational model that is able to expand its previously learned concepts efficiently to new domains using a few labeled samples. We couple the new form of a concept to its past learned forms in an embedding space for effective continual learning. Doing so, a generative distribution is learned such that it is shared across the tasks in the embedding space and models the abstract concepts. This procedure enables the model to generate pseudo-data points to replay the past experience to tackle catastrophic forgetting. 

041__ Degrees of Freedom Analysis of Unrolled Neural Networks__arXiv:1906.03742
Author: Morteza Mardani
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03742
 Abstract: Unrolled neural networks emerged recently as an effective model for learning inverse maps appearing in image restoration tasks. However, their generalization risk (i.e., test mean-squared-error) and its link to network design and train sample size remains mysterious. Leveraging the Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE), this paper analyzes the generalization risk with its bias and variance components for recurrent unrolled networks. We particularly investigate the degrees-of-freedom (DOF) component of SURE, trace of the end-to-end network Jacobian, to quantify the prediction variance. We prove that DOF is well-approximated by the weighted \textit{path sparsity} of the network under incoherence conditions on the trained weights. Empirically, we examine the SURE components as a function of train sample size for both recurrent and non-recurrent (with many more parameters) unrolled networks. Our key observations indicate that: 1) DOF increases with train sample size and converges to the generalization risk for both recurrent and non-recurrent schemes; 2) recurrent network converges significantly faster (with less train samples) compared with non-recurrent scheme, hence recurrence serves as a regularization for low sample size regimes. 

042__ Factorization Bandits for Online Influence Maximization__arXiv:1906.03737
Author: Qingyun Wu
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03737
 Abstract: We study the problem of online influence maximization in social networks. In this problem, a learner aims to identify the set of "best influencers" in a network by interacting with it, i.e., repeatedly selecting seed nodes and observing activation feedback in the network. We capitalize on an important property of the influence maximization problem named network assortativity, which is ignored by most existing works in online influence maximization. To realize network assortativity, we factorize the activation probability on the edges into latent factors on the corresponding nodes, including influence factor on the giving nodes and susceptibility factor on the receiving nodes. We propose an upper confidence bound based online learning solution to estimate the latent factors, and therefore the activation probabilities. Considerable regret reduction is achieved by our factorization based online influence maximization algorithm. And extensive empirical evaluations on two real-world networks showed the effectiveness of our proposed solution. 

043__ Intrinsically Efficient, Stable, and Bounded Off-Policy Evaluation for  Reinforcement Learning__arXiv:1906.03735
Author: Nathan Kallus
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03735
 Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) in both contextual bandits and reinforcement learning allows one to evaluate novel decision policies without needing to conduct exploration, which is often costly or otherwise infeasible. The problem's importance has attracted many proposed solutions, including importance sampling (IS), self-normalized IS (SNIS), and doubly robust (DR) estimates. DR and its variants ensure semiparametric local efficiency if Q-functions are well-specified, but if they are not they can be worse than both IS and SNIS. It also does not enjoy SNIS's inherent stability and boundedness. We propose new estimators for OPE based on empirical likelihood that are always more efficient than IS, SNIS, and DR and satisfy the same stability and boundedness properties as SNIS. On the way, we categorize various properties and classify existing estimators by them. Besides the theoretical guarantees, empirical studies suggest the new estimators provide advantages. 

044__ The Generalization-Stability Tradeoff in Neural Network Pruning__arXiv:1906.03728
Author: Brian R. Bartoldson
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03728
 Abstract: Pruning neural network parameters to reduce model size is an area of much interest, but the original motivation for pruning was the prevention of overfitting rather than the improvement of computational efficiency. This motivation is particularly relevant given the perhaps surprising observation that a wide variety of pruning approaches confer increases in test accuracy, even when parameter counts are drastically reduced. To better understand this phenomenon, we analyze the behavior of pruning over the course of training, finding that pruning's effect on generalization relies more on the instability generated by pruning than the final size of the pruned model. We demonstrate that even pruning of seemingly unimportant parameters can lead to such instability, allowing our finding to account for the generalization benefits of modern pruning techniques. Our results ultimately suggest that, counter-intuitively, pruning regularizes through instability and mechanisms unrelated to parameter counts. 

045__ Neural Heterogeneous Scheduler__arXiv:1906.03724
Author: Tegg Taekyong Sung
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03724
 Abstract: Access to parallel and distributed computation has enabled researchers and developers to improve algorithms and performance in many applications. Recent research has focused on next generation special purpose systems with multiple kinds of coprocessors, known as heterogeneous system-on-chips (SoC). In this paper, we introduce a method to intelligently schedule--and learn to schedule--a stream of tasks to available processing elements in such a system. We use deep reinforcement learning enabling complex sequential decision making and empirically show that our reinforcement learning system provides for a viable, better alternative to conventional scheduling heuristics with respect to minimizing execution time. 

046__ Aggregation of pairwise comparisons with reduction of biases__arXiv:1906.03711
Author: Nadezhda Bugakova
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03711
 Abstract: We study the problem of ranking from crowdsourced pairwise comparisons. Answers to pairwise tasks are known to be affected by the position of items on the screen, however, previous models for aggregation of pairwise comparisons do not focus on modeling such kind of biases. We introduce a new aggregation model factorBT for pairwise comparisons, which accounts for certain factors of pairwise tasks that are known to be irrelevant to the result of comparisons but may affect workers' answers due to perceptual reasons. By modeling biases that influence workers, factorBT is able to reduce the effect of biased pairwise comparisons on the resulted ranking. Our empirical studies on real-world data sets showed that factorBT produces more accurate ranking from crowdsourced pairwise comparisons than previously established models. 

047__ Curiosity-Driven Multi-Criteria Hindsight Experience Replay__arXiv:1906.03710
Author: John B. Lanier
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03710
 Abstract: Dealing with sparse rewards is a longstanding challenge in reinforcement learning. The recent use of hindsight methods have achieved success on a variety of sparse-reward tasks, but they fail on complex tasks such as stacking multiple blocks with a robot arm in simulation. Curiosity-driven exploration using the prediction error of a learned dynamics model as an intrinsic reward has been shown to be effective for exploring a number of sparse-reward environments. We present a method that combines hindsight with curiosity-driven exploration and curriculum learning in order to solve the challenging sparse-reward block stacking task. We are the first to stack more than two blocks using only sparse reward without human demonstrations.

 Abstract: In this note, we study the relationship between the variational gap and the variance of the (log) likelihood ratio. We show that the gap can be upper bounded by some form of dispersion measure of the likelihood ratio, which suggests the bias of variational inference can be reduced by making the distribution of the likelihood ratio more concentrated, such as via averaging and variance reduction. 

049__ Redundancy-Free Computation Graphs for Graph Neural Networks__arXiv:1906.03707
Author: Zhihao Jia
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03707
 Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are based on repeated aggregations of information across nodes' neighbors in a graph. However, because common neighbors are shared between different nodes, this leads to repeated and inefficient computations. We propose Hierarchically Aggregated computation Graphs (HAGs), a new GNN graph representation that explicitly avoids redundancy by managing intermediate aggregation results hierarchically, eliminating repeated computations and unnecessary data transfers in GNN training and inference. We introduce an accurate cost function to quantitatively evaluate the runtime performance of different HAGs and use a novel HAG search algorithm to find optimized HAGs. Experiments show that the HAG representation significantly outperforms the standard GNN graph representation by increasing the end-to-end training throughput by up to 2.8x and reducing the aggregations and data transfers in GNN training by up to 6.3x and 5.6x, while maintaining the original model accuracy. 

050__ SVRG for Policy Evaluation with Fewer Gradient Evaluations__arXiv:1906.03704
Author: Zilun Peng
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03704
 Abstract: Stochastic variance-reduced gradient (SVRG) is an optimization method originally designed for tackling machine learning problems with a finite sum structure. SVRG was later shown to work for policy evaluation, a problem in reinforcement learning in which one aims to estimate the value function of a given policy. SVRG makes use of gradient estimates at two scales. At the slower scale, SVRG computes a full gradient over the whole dataset, which could lead to prohibitive computation costs. In this work, we show that two variants of SVRG for policy evaluation could significantly diminish the number of gradient calculations while preserving a linear convergence speed. More importantly, our theoretical result implies that one does not need to use the entire dataset in every epoch of SVRG when it is applied to policy evaluation with linear function approximation. Our experiments demonstrate large computational savings provided by the proposed methods. 

051__ A general solver to the elliptical mixture model through an approximate  Wasserstein manifold__arXiv:1906.03700
Author: Shengxi Li
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03700
 Abstract: This paper studies the problem of estimation for general finite mixture models, with a particular focus on the elliptical mixture models (EMMs). Instead of using the widely adopted Kullback-Leibler divergence, we provide a stable solution to the EMMs that is robust to initialisations and attains superior local optimum by adaptively optimising along a manifold of an approximate Wasserstein distance. More specifically, we first summarise computable and identifiable EMMs, in order to identify the optimisation problem. Due to a probability constraint, solving this problem is cumbersome and unstable, especially under the Wasserstein distance. We thus resort to an efficient optimisation on a statistical manifold defined under an approximate Wasserstein distance, which allows for explicit metrics and operations. This is shown to significantly stabilise and improve the EMM estimations. We also propose an adaptive method to further accelerate the convergence. Experimental results demonstrate excellent performances of the proposed solver. 

052__ Balanced Off-Policy Evaluation General Action Spaces__arXiv:1906.03694
Author: Arjun Sondhi
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03694
 Abstract: In many practical applications of contextual bandits, online learning is infeasible and practitioners must rely on off-policy evaluation (OPE) of logged data collected from prior policies. OPE generally consists of a combination of two components: (i) directly estimating a model of the reward given state and action and (ii) importance sampling. While recent work has made significant advances adaptively combining these two components, less attention has been paid to improving the quality of the importance weights themselves. In this work we present balancing off-policy evaluation (BOP-e), an importance sampling procedure that directly optimizes for balance and can be plugged into any OPE estimator that uses importance sampling. BOP-e directly estimates the importance sampling ratio via a classifier which attempts to distinguish state-action pairs from an observed versus a proposed policy. BOP-e can be applied to continuous, mixed, and multi-valued action spaces without modification and is easily scalable to many observations. Further, we show that minimization of regret in the constructed binary classification problem translates directly into minimizing regret in the off-policy evaluation task. Finally, we provide experimental evidence that BOP-e outperforms inverse propensity weighting-based approaches for offline evaluation of policies in the contextual bandit setting under both discrete and continuous action spaces. 

053__ Novelty Detection via Network Saliency in Visual-based Deep Learning__arXiv:1906.03685
Author: Valerie Chen
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03685
 Abstract: Machine-learning driven safety-critical autonomous systems, such as self-driving cars, must be able to detect situations where its trained model is not able to make a trustworthy prediction. Often viewed as a black-box, it is non-obvious to determine when a model will make a safe decision and when it will make an erroneous, perhaps life-threatening one. Prior work on novelty detection deal with highly structured data and do not translate well to dynamic, real-world situations. This paper proposes a multi-step framework for the detection of novel scenarios in vision-based autonomous systems by leveraging information learned by the trained prediction model and a new image similarity metric. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method through experiments on a real-world driving dataset as well as on our in-house indoor racing environment. 

054__ Attention-based Conditioning Methods for External Knowledge Integration__arXiv:1906.03674
Author: Katerina Margatina
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03674
 Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach for incorporating external knowledge in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). We propose the integration of lexicon features into the self-attention mechanism of RNN-based architectures. This form of conditioning on the attention distribution, enforces the contribution of the most salient words for the task at hand. We introduce three methods, namely attentional concatenation, feature-based gating and affine transformation. Experiments on six benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of our methods. Attentional feature-based gating yields consistent performance improvement across tasks. Our approach is implemented as a simple add-on module for RNN-based models with minimal computational overhead and can be adapted to any deep neural architecture. 

055__ Deep Batch Active Learning by Diverse, Uncertain Gradient Lower Bounds__arXiv:1906.03671
Author: Jordan T. Ash
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03671
 Abstract: We design a new algorithm for batch active learning with deep neural network models. Our algorithm, Batch Active learning by Diverse Gradient Embeddings (BADGE), samples groups of points that are disparate and high-magnitude when represented in a hallucinated gradient space, a strategy designed to incorporate both predictive uncertainty and sample diversity into every selected batch. Crucially, BADGE trades off between diversity and uncertainty without requiring any hand-tuned hyperparameters. We show that while other approaches sometimes succeed for particular batch sizes or architectures, BADGE consistently performs as well or better, making it a versatile option for practical active learning problems. 

056__ Analytical risk  curves for $l_2$ and $l_1$ penalized interpolation__arXiv:1906.03667
Author: Partha P Mitra
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03667
 Abstract: Traditionally in regression one minimizes the number of fitting parameters or uses smoothing/regularization to trade training (TE) and generalization error (GE). Driving TE to zero by increasing fitting degrees of freedom (dof) is expected to increase GE. However modern big-data approaches, including deep nets, seem to over-parametrize and send TE to zero (data interpolation) without impacting GE. Overparametrization has the benefit that global minima of the empirical loss function proliferate and become easier to find. These phenomena have drawn theoretical attention. Regression and classification algorithms have been shown that interpolate data but also generalize optimally. An interesting related phenomenon has been noted: the existence of non-monotonic risk curves, with a peak in GE with increasing dof. It was suggested that this peak separates a classical regime from a modern regime where over-parametrization improves performance. Similar over-fitting peaks were reported previously (statistical physics approach to learning) and attributed to increased fitting model flexibility. We introduce a generative and fitting model pair ("Misparametrized Sparse Regression" or MiSpaR) and show that the overfitting peak can be dissociated from the point at which the fitting function gains enough dof's to match the data generative model and thus provides good generalization. This complicates the interpretation of overfitting peaks as separating a "classical" from a "modern" regime. Data interpolation itself cannot guarantee good generalization: we need to study the interpolation with different penalty terms. We present analytical formulae for GE curves for MiSpaR with $l_2$ and $l_1$ penalties, in the interpolating limit $\lambda\rightarrow 0$.These risk curves exhibit important differences and help elucidate the underlying phenomena.

059__ Dynamic Network Embedding via Incremental Skip-gram with Negative  Sampling__arXiv:1906.03586
Author: Hao Peng
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03586
 Abstract: Network representation learning, as an approach to learn low dimensional representations of vertices, has attracted considerable research attention recently. It has been proven extremely useful in many machine learning tasks over large graph. Most existing methods focus on learning the structural representations of vertices in a static network, but cannot guarantee an accurate and efficient embedding in a dynamic network scenario. To address this issue, we present an efficient incremental skip-gram algorithm with negative sampling for dynamic network embedding, and provide a set of theoretical analyses to characterize the performance guarantee. Specifically, we first partition a dynamic network into the updated, including addition/deletion of links and vertices, and the retained networks over time. Then we factorize the objective function of network embedding into the added, vanished and retained parts of the network. Next we provide a new stochastic gradient-based method, guided by the partitions of the network, to update the nodes and the parameter vectors. The proposed algorithm is proven to yield an objective function value with a bounded difference to that of the original objective function. Experimental results show that our proposal can significantly reduce the training time while preserving the comparable performance. We also demonstrate the correctness of the theoretical analysis and the practical usefulness of the dynamic network embedding. We perform extensive experiments on multiple real-world large network datasets over multi-label classification and link prediction tasks to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework, and up to 22 times speedup has been achieved. 

060__ Transfer Learning by Modeling a Distribution over Policies__arXiv:1906.03574
Author: Disha Shrivastava
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03574
 Abstract: Exploration and adaptation to new tasks in a transfer learning setup is a central challenge in reinforcement learning. In this work, we build on the idea of modeling a distribution over policies in a Bayesian deep reinforcement learning setup to propose a transfer strategy. Recent works have shown to induce diversity in the learned policies by maximizing the entropy of a distribution of policies (Bachman et al., 2018; Garnelo et al., 2018) and thus, we postulate that our proposed approach leads to faster exploration resulting in improved transfer learning. We support our hypothesis by demonstrating favorable experimental results on a variety of settings on fully-observable GridWorld and partially observable MiniGrid (Chevalier-Boisvert et al., 2018) environments. 

061__ Min-Max Optimization in Adversarial Attack  and Defense__arXiv:1906.03563
Author: Jingkang Wang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03563
 Abstract: The worst-case training principle that minimizes the maximal adversarial loss, also known as adversarial training (AT), has shown to be a state-of-the-art approach for enhancing adversarial robustness against norm-ball bounded input perturbations. Nonetheless, min-max optimization beyond the purpose of AT has not been rigorously explored in the research of adversarial attack and defense. In particular, given a set of risk sources (domains), minimizing the maximal loss induced from the domain set can be reformulated as a general min-max problem that is different from AT, since the maximization is taken over the probability simplex of the domain set. Examples of this general formulation include attacking model ensembles, devising universal perturbation to input samples or data transformations, and generalized AT over multiple norm-ball threat models. We show that these problems can be solved under a unified and theoretically principled min-max optimization framework. Our proposed approach leads to substantial performance improvement over the uniform averaging strategy in four different tasks. Moreover, we show how the self-adjusted weighting factors of the probability simplex from our proposed algorithms can be used to explain the importance of different attack and defense models. 

062__ Four Things Everyone Should Know to Improve Batch Normalization__arXiv:1906.03548
Author: Cecilia Summers
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03548
 Abstract: A key component of most neural network architectures is the use of normalization layers, such as Batch Normalization. Despite its common use and large utility in optimizing deep architectures that are otherwise intractable, it has been challenging both to generically improve upon Batch Normalization and to understand specific circumstances that lend themselves to other enhancements. In this paper, we identify four improvements to the generic form of Batch Normalization and the circumstances under which they work, yielding performance gains across all batch sizes while requiring no additional computation during training. These contributions include proposing a method for reasoning about the current example in inference normalization statistics which fixes a training vs. inference discrepancy; recognizing and validating the powerful regularization effect of Ghost Batch Normalization for small and medium batch sizes; examining the effect of weight decay regularization on the scaling and shifting parameters; and identifying a new normalization algorithm for very small batch sizes by combining the strengths of Batch and Group Normalization. We validate our results empirically on four datasets: CIFAR-100, SVHN, Caltech-256, and ImageNet. 

063__ Submodular selection for data summarization in Python__arXiv:1906.03543
Author: Jacob Schreiber
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03543
 Abstract: We present apricot, an open source Python package for selecting representative subsets from large data sets using submodular optimization. The package implements an efficient greedy selection algorithm that offers strong theoretical guarantees on the quality of the selected set. Two submodular set functions are implemented in apricot: facility location, which is broadly applicable but requires memory quadratic in the number of examples in the data set, and a feature-based function that is less broadly applicable but can scale to millions of examples. Apricot is extremely efficient, using both algorithmic speedups such as the lazy greedy algorithm and code optimizers such as numba. We demonstrate the use of subset selection by training machine learning models to comparable accuracy using either the full data set or a representative subset thereof. This paper presents an explanation of submodular selection, an overview of the features in apricot, and an application to several data sets. The code and tutorial Jupyter notebooks are available at this https URL 

064__ Reducing the variance in online optimization by transporting past  gradients__arXiv:1906.03532
Author: Sbastien M. R. Arnold
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03532
 Abstract: Most stochastic optimization methods use gradients once before discarding them. While variance reduction methods have shown that reusing past gradients can be beneficial when there is a finite number of datapoints, they do not easily extend to the online setting. One issue is the staleness due to using past gradients. We propose to correct this staleness using the idea of implicit gradient transport (IGT) which transforms gradients computed at previous iterates into gradients evaluated at the current iterate without using the Hessian explicitly. In addition to reducing the variance and bias of our updates over time, IGT can be used as a drop-in replacement for the gradient estimate in a number of well-understood methods such as heavy ball or Adam. We show experimentally that it achieves state-of-the-art results on a wide range of architectures and benchmarks. Additionally, the IGT gradient estimator yields the optimal asymptotic convergence rate for online stochastic optimization in the restricted setting where the Hessians of all component functions are equal. 

065__ Provably Robust Boosted Decision Stumps and Trees against Adversarial  Attacks__arXiv:1906.03526
Author: Maksym Andriushchenko
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03526
 Abstract: The problem of adversarial samples has been studied extensively for neural networks. However, for boosting, in particular boosted decision trees and decision stumps there are almost no results, even though boosted decision trees, as e.g. XGBoost, are quite popular due to their interpretability and good prediction performance. We show in this paper that for boosted decision stumps the exact min-max optimal robust loss and test error for an $l_\infty$-attack can be computed in $O(n\,T\log T)$, where $T$ is the number of decision stumps and $n$ the number of data points, as well as an optimal update of the ensemble in $O(n^2\,T\log T)$. While not exact, we show how to optimize an upper bound on the robust loss for boosted trees. Up to our knowledge, these are the first algorithms directly optimizing provable robustness guarantees in the area of boosting. We make the code of all our experiments publicly available at this https URL 

066__ Maximum Weighted Loss Discrepancy__arXiv:1906.03518
Author: Fereshte Khani
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03518
 Abstract: Though machine learning algorithms excel at minimizing the average loss over a population, this might lead to large discrepancies between the losses across groups within the population. To capture this inequality, we introduce and study a notion we call maximum weighted loss discrepancy (MWLD), the maximum (weighted) difference between the loss of a group and the loss of the population. We relate MWLD to group fairness notions and robustness to demographic shifts. We then show MWLD satisfies the following three properties: 1) It is statistically impossible to estimate MWLD when all groups have equal weights. 2) For a particular family of weighting functions, we can estimate MWLD efficiently. 3) MWLD is related to loss variance, a quantity that arises in generalization bounds. We estimate MWLD with different weighting functions on four common datasets from the fairness literature. We finally show that loss variance regularization can halve the loss variance of a classifier and hence reduce MWLD without suffering a significant drop in accuracy. 

067__ Simultaneous Classification and Novelty Detection Using Deep Neural  Networks__arXiv:1906.03509
Author: Aristotelis-Angelos Papadopoulos
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03509
 Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved great success in classification tasks during the last years. However, one major problem to the path towards artificial intelligence is the inability of neural networks to accurately detect novel class distributions and therefore, most of the classification algorithms proposed make the assumption that all classes are known prior to the training stage. In this work, we propose a methodology for training a neural network that allows it to efficiently detect novel class distributions without compromising much of its classification accuracy on the test examples of known classes. Experimental results on the CIFAR 100 and MiniImagenet data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The way this method was constructed also makes it suitable for training any classification algorithm that is based on Maximum Likelihood methods. 

068__ Convolutional Bipartite Attractor Networks__arXiv:1906.03504
Author: Michael Iuzzolino
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03504
 Abstract: In human perception and cognition, the fundamental operation that brains perform is interpretation: constructing coherent neural states from noisy, incomplete, and intrinsically ambiguous evidence. The problem of interpretation is well matched to an early and often overlooked architecture, the attractor network---a recurrent neural network that performs constraint satisfaction, imputation of missing features, and clean up of noisy data via energy minimization dynamics. We revisit attractor nets in light of modern deep learning methods, and propose a convolutional bipartite architecture with a novel training loss, activation function, and connectivity constraints. We tackle problems much larger than have been previously explored with attractor nets and demonstrate their potential for image denoising, completion, and super-resolution. We argue that this architecture is better motivated than ever-deeper feedforward models and is a viable alternative to more costly sampling-based methods on a range of supervised and unsupervised tasks. 

069__ Detecting Adversarial Examples with Feature Attribution__arXiv:1906.03499
Author: Puyudi Yang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03499
 Abstract: Deep neural networks obtain state-of-the-art performance on a series of tasks. However, they are easily fooled by adding a small adversarial perturbation to input. The perturbation is often human imperceptible on image data. We observe a significant difference in feature attributions of adversarially crafted examples from those of original ones. Based on this observation, we introduce a new framework to detect adversarial examples through thresholding a scale estimate of feature attribution scores. Furthermore, we extend our method to include multi-layer feature attributions in order to tackle the attacks with mixed confidence levels. Through vast experiments, our method achieves superior performances in distinguishing adversarial examples from popular attack methods on a variety of real data sets among state-of-the-art detection methods. In particular, our method is able to detect adversarial examples of mixed confidence levels, and transfer between different attacking methods. 

070__ Learning Radiative Transfer Models for Climate Change Applications in  Imaging Spectroscopy__arXiv:1906.03479
Author: Shubhankar Deshpande
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03479
 Abstract: According to a recent investigation, an estimated 33-50% of the world's coral reefs have undergone degradation, believed to be as a result of climate change. A strong driver of climate change and the subsequent environmental impact are greenhouse gases such as methane. However, the exact relation climate change has to the environmental condition cannot be easily established. Remote sensing methods are increasingly being used to quantify and draw connections between rapidly changing climatic conditions and environmental impact. A crucial part of this analysis is processing spectroscopy data using radiative transfer models (RTMs) which is a computationally expensive process and limits their use with high volume imaging spectrometers. This work presents an algorithm that can efficiently emulate RTMs using neural networks leading to a multifold speedup in processing time, and yielding multiple downstream benefits. 

071__ A topology for pipelined implementations of  convolutional neural networks using computational memory__arXiv:1906.03474
Author: Martino Dazzi
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03474
 Abstract: In-memory computing is an emerging computing paradigm that could enable deeplearning inference at significantly higher energy efficiency and reduced latency. The essential idea is to map the synaptic weights corresponding to each layer to one or more computational memory (CM) cores. During inference, these cores perform the associated matrix-vector multiply operations in place with O(1) time complexity, thus obviating the need to move the synaptic weights to an additional processing unit. Moreover, this architecture could enable the execution of these networks in a highly pipelined fashion. However, a key challenge is to design an efficient communication fabric for the CM cores. Here, we present one such communication fabric based on a graph topology that is well suited for the widely successful convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We show that this communication fabric facilitates the pipelined execution of all state of-the-art CNNs by proving the existence of a homomorphism between one graph representation of these networks and the proposed graph topology. We then present a quantitative comparison with established communication topologies and show that our proposed topology achieves the lowest bandwidth requirements per communication channel. Finally, we present a concrete example of mapping ResNet-32 onto an array of CM cores. 

072__ A gradual, semi-discrete approach to generative network training via  explicit wasserstein minimization__arXiv:1906.03471
Author: Yucheng Chen
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03471
 Abstract: This paper provides a simple procedure to fit generative networks to target distributions, with the goal of a small Wasserstein distance (or other optimal transport cost). The approach is based on two principles: (a) if the source randomness of the network is a continuous distribution (the "semi-discrete" setting), then the Wasserstein distance is realized by a deterministic optimal transport mapping; (b) given an optimal transport mapping between a generator network and a target distribution, the Wasserstein distance may be decreased via a regression between the generated data and the mapped target points. The procedure here therefore alternates these two steps, forming an optimal transport and regressing against it, gradually adjusting the generator network towards the target distribution. Mathematically, this approach is shown to minimize the Wasserstein distance to both the empirical target distribution, and also its underlying population counterpart. Empirically, good performance is demonstrated on the training and testing sets of the MNIST and Thin-8 data. The paper closes with a discussion of the unsuitability of the Wasserstein distance for certain tasks, as has been identified in prior work [Arora et al., 2017, Huang et al., 2017]. 

073__ Sensitivity of Deep Convolutional Networks to Gabor Noise__arXiv:1906.03455
Author: Kenneth T. Co
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03455
 Abstract: Deep Convolutional Networks (DCNs) have been shown to be sensitive to Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs): input-agnostic perturbations that fool a model on large portions of a dataset. These UAPs exhibit interesting visual patterns, but this phenomena is, as yet, poorly understood. Our work shows that visually similar procedural noise patterns also act as UAPs. In particular, we demonstrate that different DCN architectures are sensitive to Gabor noise patterns. This behaviour, its causes, and implications deserve further in-depth study. 

074__ A Two-Step Graph Convolutional Decoder for Molecule Generation__arXiv:1906.03412
Author: Xavier Bresson
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03412
 Abstract: We propose a simple auto-encoder framework for molecule generation. The molecular graph is first encoded into a continuous latent representation $z$, which is then decoded back to a molecule. The encoding process is easy, but the decoding process remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a simple two-step decoding process. In a first step, a fully connected neural network uses the latent vector $z$ to produce a molecular formula, for example CO$_2$ (one carbon and two oxygen atoms). In a second step, a graph convolutional neural network uses the same latent vector $z$ to place bounds between the atoms that were produced in the first step (for example a double bound will be placed between the carbon and each of the oxygens). This two-step process, in which a bag of atoms is first generated, and then assembled, provides a simple framework that allows us to develop an efficient molecule auto-encoder. Numerical experiments on basic tasks such as novelty, uniqueness, validity and optimized chemical property for the 250k ZINC molecules demonstrate the performances of the proposed system. Particularly, we achieve the highest reconstruction rate of 90.5\%, improving the previous rate of 76.7\%. We also report the best property improvement results when optimization is constrained by the molecular distance between the original and generated molecules. 

075__ Making targeted black-box evasion attacks effective and efficient__arXiv:1906.03397
Author: Mika Juuti
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03397
 Abstract: We investigate how an adversary can optimally use its query budget for targeted evasion attacks against deep neural networks in a black-box setting. We formalize the problem setting and systematically evaluate what benefits the adversary can gain by using substitute models. We show that there is an exploration-exploitation tradeoff in that query efficiency comes at the cost of effectiveness. We present two new attack strategies for using substitute models and show that they are as effective as previous query-only techniques but require significantly fewer queries, by up to three orders of magnitude. We also show that an agile adversary capable of switching through different attack techniques can achieve pareto-optimal efficiency. We demonstrate our attack against Google Cloud Vision showing that the difficulty of black-box attacks against real-world prediction APIs is significantly easier than previously thought (requiring approximately 500 queries instead of approximately 20,000 as in previous works). 

076__ Optimal Off-Policy Evaluation for Reinforcement Learning with  Marginalized Importance Sampling__arXiv:1906.03393
Author: Tengyang Xie
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03393
 Abstract: Motivated by the many real-world applications of reinforcement learning (RL) that require safe-policy iterations, we consider the problem of off-policy evaluation (OPE) --- the problem of evaluating a new policy using the historical data obtained by different behavior policies --- under the model of nonstationary episodic Markov Decision Processes with a long horizon and large action space. Existing importance sampling (IS) methods often suffer from large variance that depends exponentially on the RL horizon $H$. To solve this problem, we consider a marginalized importance sampling (MIS) estimator that recursively estimates the state marginal distribution for the target policy at every step. MIS achieves a mean-squared error of $O(H^2R_{\max}^2\sum_{t=1}^H\mathbb E_\mu[(w_{\pi,\mu}(s_t,a_t))^2]/n)$ for large $n$, where $w_{\pi,\mu}(s_t,a_t)$ is the ratio of the marginal distribution of $t$th step under $\pi$ and $\mu$, $H$ is the horizon, $R_{\max}$ is the maximal rewards, and $n$ is the sample size. The result nearly matches the Cramer-Rao lower bounds for DAG MDP in \citet{jiang2016doubly} for most non-trivial regimes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first OPE estimator with provably optimal dependence in $H$ and the second moments of the importance weight. Besides theoretical optimality, we empirically demonstrate the superiority of our method in time-varying, partially observable, and long-horizon RL environments. 

077__ Using learned optimizers to make models robust to input noise__arXiv:1906.03367
Author: Luke Metz
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03367
 Abstract: State-of-the art vision models can achieve superhuman performance on image classification tasks when testing and training data come from the same distribution. However, when models are tested on corrupted images (e.g. due to scale changes, translations, or shifts in brightness or contrast), performance degrades significantly. Here, we explore the possibility of meta-training a learned optimizer that can train image classification models such that they are robust to common image corruptions. Specifically, we are interested training models that are more robust to noise distributions not present in the training data. We find that a learned optimizer meta-trained to produce models which are robust to Gaussian noise trains models that are more robust to Gaussian noise at other scales compared to traditional optimizers like Adam. The effect of meta-training is more complicated when targeting a more general set of noise distributions, but led to improved performance on half of held-out corruption tasks. Our results suggest that meta-learning provides a novel approach for studying and improving the robustness of deep learning models. 

078__ Online Forecasting of Total-Variation-bounded Sequences__arXiv:1906.03364
Author: Dheeraj Baby
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03364
 Abstract: We consider the problem of online forecasting of sequences of length $n$ with total-variation at most $C_n$ using observations contaminated by independent $\sigma$-subgaussian noise. We design an $O(n\log n)$-time algorithm that achieves a cumulative square error of $\tilde{O}(n^{1/3}C_n^{2/3}\sigma^{4/3})$ with high probability. The result is rate-optimal as it matches the known minimax rate for the offline nonparametric estimation of the same class [Mammen and van de Geer, 1997]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first \emph{polynomial-time} algorithm that optimally forecasts total variation bounded sequences. Our proof techniques leverage the special localized structure of Haar wavelet basis and adaptivity to unknown smoothness parameter in the classical wavelet smoothing [Donoho et al., 1998]. We also compare our model to the rich literature of dynamic regret minimization and nonstationary stochastic optimization, where our problem can be treated as a special case. We show that the workhorse in those settings --- online gradient descent and its variants with a fixed restarting schedule --- are instances of a class of \emph{linear forecasters} that require a suboptimal regret of $\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{n})$. This implies that the use of more adaptive algorithms are necessary to obtain the optimal rate. 

079__ Partially Linear Additive Gaussian Graphical Models__arXiv:1906.03362
Author: Sinong Geng
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03362
 Abstract: We propose a partially linear additive Gaussian graphical model (PLA-GGM) for the estimation of associations between random variables distorted by observed confounders. Model parameters are estimated using an $L_1$-regularized maximal pseudo-profile likelihood estimator (MaPPLE) for which we prove $\sqrt{n}$-sparsistency. Importantly, our approach avoids parametric constraints on the effects of confounders on the estimated graphical model structure. Empirically, the PLA-GGM is applied to both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to competing methods. 

080__ Robust Bi-Tempered Logistic Loss Based on Bregman Divergences__arXiv:1906.03361
Author: Ehsan Amid
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03361
 Abstract: We introduce a temperature into the exponential function and replace the softmax output layer of neural nets by a high temperature generalization. Similarly, the logarithm in the log loss we use for training is replaced by a low temperature logarithm. By tuning the two temperatures we create loss functions that are non-convex already in the single layer case. When replacing the last layer of the neural nets by our two temperature generalization of logistic regression, the training becomes more robust to noise. We visualize the effect of tuning the two temperatures in a simple setting and show the efficacy of our method on large data sets. Our methodology is based on Bregman divergences and is superior to a related two-temperature method using the Tsallis divergence. 

081__ Meta-Learning from Demonstrations and Reward__arXiv:1906.03352
Author: Allan Zhou
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03352
 Abstract: Imitation learning allows agents to learn complex behaviors from demonstrations. However, learning a complex vision-based task may require an impractical number of demonstrations. Meta-imitation learning is a promising approach towards enabling agents to learn a new task from one or a few demonstrations by leveraging experience from learning similar tasks. In the presence of task ambiguity or unobserved dynamics, demonstrations alone may not provide enough information; an agent must also try the task to successfully infer a policy. In this work, we propose a method that can learn to learn from both demonstrations and trial-and-error experience with sparse reward feedback. In comparison to meta-imitation, this approach enables the agent to effectively and efficiently improve itself autonomously beyond the demonstration data. In comparison to meta-reinforcement learning, we can scale to substantially broader distributions of tasks, as the demonstration reduces the burden of exploration. Our experiments show that our method significantly outperforms prior approaches on a set of challenging, vision-based control tasks. 

082__ Real or Fake? Learning to Discriminate Machine from Human Generated Text__arXiv:1906.03351
Author: Anton Bakhtin
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03351
 Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling of text have demonstrated remarkable improvements in terms of fluency and coherency. In this work we investigate to which extent a machine can discriminate real from machine generated text. This is important in itself for automatic detection of computer generated stories, but can also serve as a tool for further improving text generation. We show that learning a dedicated scoring function to discriminate between real and fake text achieves higher precision than employing the likelihood of a generative model. The scoring functions generalize to other generators than those used for training as long as these generators have comparable model complexity and are trained on similar datasets. 

083__ Efficient Project Gradient Descent for Ensemble Adversarial Attack__arXiv:1906.03333
Author: Fanyou Wu
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03333
 Abstract: Recent advances show that deep neural networks are not robust to deliberately crafted adversarial examples which many are generated by adding human imperceptible perturbation to clear input. Consider $l_2$ norms attacks, Project Gradient Descent (PGD) and the Carlini and Wagner (C\&W) attacks are the two main methods, where PGD control max perturbation for adversarial examples while C\&W approach treats perturbation as a regularization term optimized it with loss function together. If we carefully set parameters for any individual input, both methods become similar. In general, PGD attacks perform faster but obtains larger perturbation to find adversarial examples than the C\&W when fixing the parameters for all inputs. In this report, we propose an efficient modified PGD method for attacking ensemble models by automatically changing ensemble weights and step size per iteration per input. This method generates smaller perturbation adversarial examples than PGD method while remains efficient as compared to C\&W method. Our method won the first place in IJCAI19 Targeted Adversarial Attack competition. 

084__ Empirical Likelihood for Contextual Bandits__arXiv:1906.03323
Author: Nikos Karampatziakis
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03323
 Abstract: We apply empirical likelihood techniques to contextual bandit policy value estimation, confidence intervals, and learning. We propose a tighter estimator for off-policy evaluation with improved statistical performance over previous proposals. Coupled with this estimator is a confidence interval which also improves over previous proposals. We then harness these to improve learning from contextual bandit data. Each of these is empirically evaluated to show good performance against strong baselines in finite sample regimes. 

085__ Attacks, Defenses and  Large Sample Limits__arXiv:1906.03310
Author: Yao-Yuan Yang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03310
 Abstract: Adversarial examples have received a great deal of recent attention because of their potential to uncover security flaws in machine learning systems. However, most prior work on adversarial examples has been on parametric classifiers, for which generic attack and defense methods are known; non-parametric methods have been only considered on an ad-hoc or classifier-specific basis. In this work, we take a holistic look at adversarial examples for non-parametric methods. We first provide a general region-based attack that applies to a wide range of classifiers, including nearest neighbors, decision trees, and random forests. Motivated by the close connection between non-parametric methods and the Bayes Optimal classifier, we next exhibit a robust analogue to the Bayes Optimal, and we use it to motivate a novel and generic defense that we call adversarial pruning. We empirically show that the region-based attack and adversarial pruning defense are either better than or competitive with existing attacks and defenses for non-parametric methods, while being considerably more generally applicable. 

086__ Clustering Degree-Corrected Stochastic Block Model with Outliers__arXiv:1906.03305
Author: Xin Qian
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03305
 Abstract: For the degree corrected stochastic block model in the presence of arbitrary or even adversarial outliers, we develop a convex-optimization-based clustering algorithm that includes a penalization term depending on the positive deviation of a node from the expected number of edges to other inliers. We prove that under mild conditions, this method achieves exact recovery of the underlying clusters. Our synthetic experiments show that our algorithm performs well on heterogeneous networks, and in particular those with Pareto degree distributions, for which outliers have a broad range of possible degrees that may enhance their adversarial power. We also demonstrate that our method allows for recovery with significantly lower error rates compared to existing algorithms. 

087__ Understanding Generalization through Visualizations__arXiv:1906.03291
Author: W. Ronny Huang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03291
 Abstract: The power of neural networks lies in their ability to generalize to unseen data, yet the underlying reasons for this phenomenon remains elusive. Numerous rigorous attempts have been made to explain generalization, but available bounds are still quite loose, and analysis does not always lead to true understanding. The goal of this work is to make generalization more intuitive. Using visualization methods, we discuss the mystery of generalization, the geometry of loss landscapes, and how the curse (or, rather, the blessing) of dimensionality causes optimizers to settle into minima that generalize well. 

088__ Latent feature disentanglement for 3D meshes__arXiv:1906.03281
Author: Jake Levinson
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03281
 Abstract: Generative modeling of 3D shapes has become an important problem due to its relevance to many applications across Computer Vision, Graphics, and VR. In this paper we build upon recently introduced 3D mesh-convolutional Variational AutoEncoders which have shown great promise for learning rich representations of deformable 3D shapes. We introduce a supervised generative 3D mesh model that disentangles the latent shape representation into independent generative factors. Our extensive experimental analysis shows that learning an explicitly disentangled representation can both improve random shape generation as well as successfully address downstream tasks such as pose and shape transfer, shape-invariant temporal synchronization, and pose-invariant shape matching. 

089__ Learning Individual Styles of Conversational Gesture__arXiv:1906.04160
Author: Shiry Ginosar
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04160
 Abstract: Human speech is often accompanied by hand and arm gestures. Given audio speech input, we generate plausible gestures to go along with the sound. Specifically, we perform cross-modal translation from "in-the-wild'' monologue speech of a single speaker to their hand and arm motion. We train on unlabeled videos for which we only have noisy pseudo ground truth from an automatic pose detection system. Our proposed model significantly outperforms baseline methods in a quantitative comparison. To support research toward obtaining a computational understanding of the relationship between gesture and speech, we release a large video dataset of person-specific gestures.

090__ Inference and Uncertainty Quantification for Noisy Matrix Completion__arXiv:1906.04159
Author: Yuxin Chen
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04159
 Abstract: Noisy matrix completion aims at estimating a low-rank matrix given only partial and corrupted entries. Despite substantial progress in designing efficient estimation algorithms, it remains largely unclear how to assess the uncertainty of the obtained estimates and how to perform statistical inference on the unknown matrix (e.g.~constructing a valid and short confidence interval for an unseen entry). This paper takes a step towards inference and uncertainty quantification for noisy matrix completion. We develop a simple procedure to compensate for the bias of the widely used convex and nonconvex estimators. The resulting de-biased estimators admit nearly precise non-asymptotic distributional characterizations, which in turn enable optimal construction of confidence intervals\,/\,regions for, say, the missing entries and the low-rank factors. Our inferential procedures do not rely on sample splitting, thus avoiding unnecessary loss of data efficiency. As a byproduct, we obtain a sharp characterization of the estimation accuracy of our de-biased estimators, which, to the best of our knowledge, are the first tractable algorithms that provably achieve full statistical efficiency (including the preconstant). The analysis herein is built upon the intimate link between convex and nonconvex optimization --- an appealing feature recently discovered by \cite{chen2019noisy}. 

091__ Confidence intervals for class prevalences under prior probability shift__arXiv:1906.04119
Author: Dirk Tasche
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04119
 Abstract: Point estimation of class prevalences in the presence of data set shift has been a popular research topic for more than two decades. Less attention has been paid to the construction of confidence and prediction intervals for estimates of class prevalences. One little considered question is whether or not it is necessary for practical purposes to distinguish confidence and prediction intervals. Another question so far not yet conclusively answered is whether or not the discriminatory power of the classifier or score at the basis of an estimation method matters for the accuracy of the estimates of the class prevalences. This paper presents a simulation study aimed at shedding some light on these and other related questions. 

092__ Smooth, Locally-Adaptive Factorization of  Functional Matrices__arXiv:1906.04072
Author: Wesley Tansey
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04072
 Abstract: We consider the problem of functional matrix factorization, finding low-dimensional structure in a matrix where every entry is a noisy function evaluated at a set of discrete points. Such problems arise frequently in drug discovery, where biological samples form the rows, candidate drugs form the columns, and entries contain the dose-response curve of a sample treated at different concentrations of a drug. We propose Bayesian Tensor Filtering (BTF), a hierarchical Bayesian model of matrices of functions. BTF captures the smoothness in each individual function while also being locally adaptive to sharp discontinuities. The BTF model is agnostic to the likelihood of the underlying observations, making it flexible enough to handle many different kinds of data. We derive efficient Gibbs samplers for three classes of likelihoods: (i) Gaussian, for which updates are fully conjugate; (ii) Binomial and related likelihoods, for which updates are conditionally conjugate through P{\'o}lya--Gamma augmentation; and (iii) Black-box likelihoods, for which updates are non-conjugate but admit an analytic truncated elliptical slice sampling routine. We compare BTF against a state-of-the-art method for dynamic Poisson matrix factorization, showing BTF better reconstructs held out data in synthetic experiments. Finally, we build a dose-response model around BTF and show on real data from a multi-sample, multi-drug cancer study that BTF outperforms the current standard approach in biology.

093__ On the Insufficiency of the Large Margins Theory in Explaining the  Performance of Ensemble Methods__arXiv:1906.04063
Author: Waldyn Martinez
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04063
 Abstract: Boosting and other ensemble methods combine a large number of weak classifiers through weighted voting to produce stronger predictive models. To explain the successful performance of boosting algorithms, Schapire et al. (1998) showed that AdaBoost is especially effective at increasing the margins of the training data. Schapire et al. (1998) also developed an upper bound on the generalization error of any ensemble based on the margins of the training data, from which it was concluded that larger margins should lead to lower generalization error, everything else being equal (sometimes referred to as the ``large margins theory''). Tighter bounds have been derived and have reinforced the large margins theory hypothesis. For instance, Wang et al. (2011) suggest that specific margin instances, such as the equilibrium margin, can better summarize the margins distribution. These results have led many researchers to consider direct optimization of the margins to improve ensemble generalization error with mixed results. We show that the large margins theory is not sufficient for explaining the performance of voting classifiers. We do this by illustrating how it is possible to improve upon the margin distribution of an ensemble solution, while keeping the complexity fixed, yet not improve the test set performance.

 Abstract: Radiomics is an exciting new area of texture research for extracting quantitative and morphological characteristics of pathological tissue. However, to date, only single images have been used for texture analysis. We have extended radiomic texture methods to use multiparametric (mp) data to get more complete information from all the images. These mpRadiomic methods could potentially provide a platform for stratification of tumor grade as well as assessment of treatment response in brain tumors. In brain, multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) are based on contrast enhanced T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), T2WI, Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR), Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) and Perfusion Weighted Imaging (PWI). Therefore, we applied our multiparametric radiomic framework (mpRadiomic) on 24 patients with brain tumors (8 grade II and 16 grade IV). The mpRadiomic framework classified grade IV tumors from grade II tumors with a sensitivity and specificity of 93% and 100%, respectively, with an AUC of 0.95. For treatment response, the mpRadiomic framework classified pseudo-progression from true-progression with an AUC of 0.93. In conclusion, the mpRadiomic analysis was able to effectively capture the multiparametric brain MRI texture and could be used as potential biomarkers for distinguishing grade IV from grade II tumors as well as determining true-progression from pseudo-progression. 

095__ Capturing Uncertainty in Medical Image Segmentation__arXiv:1906.04045
Author: Christian F. Baumgartner
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04045
 Abstract: Segmentation of anatomical structures and pathologies is inherently ambiguous. For instance, structure borders may not be clearly visible or different experts may have different styles of annotating. The majority of current state-of-the-art methods do not account for such ambiguities but rather learn a single mapping from image to segmentation. In this work, we propose a novel method to model the conditional probability distribution of the segmentations given an input image. We derive a hierarchical probabilistic model, in which separate latent spaces are responsible for modelling the segmentation at different resolutions. Inference in this model can be efficiently performed using the variational autoencoder framework. We show that our proposed method can be used to generate significantly more realistic and diverse segmentation samples compared to recent related work, both, when trained with annotations from a single or multiple annotators. 

096__ Statistical Detection and Visualization of Generated Text__arXiv:1906.04043
Author: Sebastian Gehrmann
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04043
 Abstract: The rapid improvement of language models has raised the specter of abuse of text generation systems. This progress motivates the development of simple methods for detecting generated text that can be used by and explained to non-experts. We develop GLTR, a tool to support humans in detecting whether a text was generated by a model. GLTR applies a suite of baseline statistical methods that can detect generation artifacts across common sampling schemes. In a human-subjects study, we show that the annotation scheme provided by GLTR improves the human detection-rate of fake text from 54% to 72% without any prior training. GLTR is open-source and publicly deployed, and has already been widely used to detect generated outputs 

097__ Neural Spline Flows__arXiv:1906.04032
Author: Conor Durkan
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04032
 Abstract: A normalizing flow models a complex probability density as an invertible transformation of a simple base density. Flows based on either coupling or autoregressive transforms both offer exact density evaluation and sampling, but rely on the parameterization of an easily invertible elementwise transformation, whose choice determines the flexibility of these models. Building upon recent work, we propose a fully-differentiable module based on monotonic rational-quadratic splines, which enhances the flexibility of both coupling and autoregressive transforms while retaining analytic invertibility. We demonstrate that neural spline flows improve density estimation, variational inference, and generative modeling of images. 

098__ "Did You Hear That?" Learning to Play Video Games from Audio Cues__arXiv:1906.04027
Author: Raluca D. Gaina
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04027
 Abstract: Game-playing AI research has focused for a long time on learning to play video games from visual input or symbolic information. However, humans benefit from a wider array of sensors which we utilise in order to navigate the world around us. In particular, sounds and music are key to how many of us perceive the world and influence the decisions we make. In this paper, we present initial experiments on game-playing agents learning to play video games solely from audio cues. We expand the Video Game Description Language to allow for audio specification, and the General Video Game AI framework to provide new audio games and an API for learning agents to make use of audio observations. We analyse the games and the audio game design process, include initial results with simple Q~Learning agents, and encourage further research in this area. 

099__ A Forever Gameplayer__arXiv:1906.04023
Author: Raluca D. Gaina
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04023
 Abstract: The space of Artificial Intelligence entities is dominated by conversational bots. Some of them fit in our pockets and we take them everywhere we go, or allow them to be a part of human homes. Siri, Alexa, they are recognised as present in our world. But a lot of games research is restricted to existing in the separate realm of software. We enter different worlds when playing games, but those worlds cease to exist once we quit. Similarly, AI game-players are run once on a game (or maybe for longer periods of time, in the case of learning algorithms which need some, still limited, period for training), and they cease to exist once the game ends. But what if they didn't? What if there existed artificial game-players that continuously played games, learned from their experiences and kept getting better? What if they interacted with the real world and us, humans: live-streaming games, chatting with viewers, accepting suggestions for strategies or games to play, forming opinions on popular game titles? In this paper, we introduce the vision behind a new project called Thyia, which focuses around creating a present, continuous, `always-on', interactive game-player. 

100__ Acceleration of Radiation Transport Solves Using Artificial Neural  Networks__arXiv:1906.04017
Author: Mauricio Tano
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04017
 Abstract: Discontinuous Finite Element Methods (DFEM) have been widely used for solving $S_n$ radiation transport problems in participative and non-participative media. In the DFEM $S_n$ methodology, the transport equation is discretized into a set of algebraic equations that have to be solved for each spatial cell and angular direction, strictly preserving the following of radiation in the system. At the core of a DFEM solver a small matrix-vector system (of 8 independent equations for tri-linear DFEM in 3D hexehdral cells) has to be assembled and solved for each cell, angle, energy group, and time step. These systems are generally solved by direct Gaussian Elimination. The computational cost of the Gaussian Elimination, repeated for each phase-space cell, amounts to a large fraction to the total compute time. Here, we have designed a Machine Learning algorithm based in a shallow Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to replace that Gaussian Elimination step, enabling a sizeable speed up in the solution process. The key idea is to train an ANN with a large set of solutions of random one-cell transport problems and then to use the trained ANN to replace Gaussian Elimination large scale transport solvers. It has been observed that ANNs decrease the solution times by at least a factor of 4, while introducing mean absolute errors between 1-3 \% in large scale transport solutions. 

101__ Covariant Molecular Neural Networks__arXiv:1906.04015
Author: Brandon Anderson
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04015
 Abstract: We propose Cormorant, a rotationally covariant neural network architecture for learning the behavior and properties of complex many-body physical systems. We apply these networks to molecular systems with two goals: learning atomic potential energy surfaces for use in Molecular Dynamics simulations, and learning ground state properties of molecules calculated by Density Functional Theory. Some of the key features of our network are that (a) each neuron explicitly corresponds to a subset of atoms; (b) the activation of each neuron is covariant to rotations, ensuring that overall the network is fully rotationally invariant. Furthermore, the non-linearity in our network is based upon tensor products and the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition, allowing the network to operate entirely in Fourier space. Cormorant significantly outperforms competing algorithms in learning molecular Potential Energy Surfaces from conformational geometries in the MD-17 dataset, and is competitive with other methods at learning geometric, energetic, electronic, and thermodynamic properties of molecules on the GDB-9 dataset. 

102__ Achieving low tail latency during distributed image  classification using coded redundancy models__arXiv:1906.03999
Author: Krishna Narra
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03999
 Abstract: Reducing the latency variance in machine learning inference is a key requirement in many applications. Variance is harder to control in a cloud deployment in the presence of stragglers. In spite of this challenge, inference is increasingly being done in the cloud, due to the advent of affordable machine learning as a service (MLaaS) platforms. Existing approaches to reduce variance rely on replication which is expensive and partially negates the affordability of MLaaS. In this work, we argue that MLaaS platforms also provide unique opportunities to cut the cost of redundancy. In MLaaS platforms, multiple inference requests are concurrently received by a load balancer which can then create a more cost-efficient redundancy coding across a larger collection of images. We propose a novel convolutional neural network model, Collage-CNN, to provide a low-cost redundancy framework. A Collage-CNN model takes a collage formed by combining multiple images and performs multi-image classification in one shot, albeit at slightly lower accuracy. We then augment a collection of traditional single image classifiers with a single Collage-CNN classifier which acts as a low-cost redundant backup. Collage-CNN then provides backup classification results if a single image classification straggles. Deploying the Collage-CNN models in the cloud, we demonstrate that the 99th percentile tail latency of inference can be reduced by 1.47X compared to replication based approaches while providing high accuracy. Also, variation in inference latency can be reduced by 9X with a slight increase in average inference latency. 

103__ Predicting Global Variations in Outdoor PM2.5 Concentrations using  Satellite Images and Deep Convolutional Neural Networks__arXiv:1906.03975
Author: Kris Y. Hong
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03975
 Abstract: Here we present a new method of estimating global variations in outdoor PM$_{2.5}$ concentrations using satellite images combined with ground-level measurements and deep convolutional neural networks. Specifically, new deep learning models were trained over the global PM$_{2.5}$ concentration range ($<$1-436 $\mu$g/m$^3$) using a large database of satellite images paired with ground level PM$_{2.5}$ measurements available from the World Health Organization. Final model selection was based on a systematic evaluation of well-known architectures for the convolutional base including InceptionV3, Xception, and VGG16. The Xception architecture performed best and the final global model had a root mean square error (RMSE) value of 13.01 $\mu$g/m$^3$ (R$^2$=0.75) in the disjoint test set. The predictive performance of our new global model (called IMAGE-PM$_{2.5}$) is similar to the current state-of-the-art model used in the Global Burden of Disease study but relies only on satellite images as input. As a result, the IMAGE-PM$_{2.5}$ model offers a fast, cost-effective means of estimating global variations in long-term average PM$_{2.5}$ concentrations and may be particularly useful for regions without ground monitoring data or detailed emissions inventories. The IMAGE-PM$_{2.5}$ model can be used as a stand-alone method of global exposure estimation or incorporated into more complex hierarchical model structures. 

104__ Exploration and Exploitation in Symbolic Regression using  Quality-Diversity and Evolutionary Strategies Algorithms__arXiv:1906.03959
Author: J.-P. Bruneton
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03959
 Abstract: By combining Genetic Programming, MAP-Elites and Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy, we demonstrate very high success rates in Symbolic Regression problems. MAP-Elites is used to improve exploration while preserving diversity and avoiding premature convergence and bloat. Then, a Covariance Matrix Adaptation-Evolution Strategy is used to evaluate free scalars through a non-gradient-based black-box optimizer. Although this evaluation approach is not computationally scalable to high dimensional problems, our algorithm is able to find exactly most of the $31$ targets extracted from the literature on which we evaluate it. 

105__ Type-Driven Automated Learning with Lale__arXiv:1906.03957
Author: Martin Hirzel
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03957
 Abstract: Machine-learning automation tools, ranging from humble grid-search to hyperopt, auto-sklearn, and TPOT, help explore large search spaces of possible pipelines. Unfortunately, each of these tools has a different syntax for specifying its search space, leading to lack of portability, missed relevant points, and spurious points that are inconsistent with error checks and documentation of the searchable base components. This paper proposes using types (such as enum, float, or dictionary) both for checking the correctness of, and for automatically searching over, hyperparameters and pipeline configurations. Using types for both of these purposes guarantees consistency. We present Lale, an embedded language that resembles scikit learn but provides better automation, correctness checks, and portability. Lale extends the reach of existing automation tools across data modalities (tables, text, images, time-series) and programming languages (Python, Java, R). Thus, data scientists can leverage automation while remaining in control of their work. 

106__ Solving Electrical Impedance Tomography with Deep Learning__arXiv:1906.03944
Author: Yuwei Fan
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03944
 Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach for solving electrical impedance tomography (EIT) problems using deep neural networks. The mathematical problem of EIT is to invert the electrical conductivity from the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map. Both the forward map from the electrical conductivity to the DtN map and the inverse map are high-dimensional and nonlinear. Motivated by the linear perturbative analysis of the forward map and based on a numerically low-rank property, we propose compact neural network architectures for the forward and inverse maps for both 2D and 3D problems. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed neural networks. 

107__ Learning to combine Grammatical Error Corrections__arXiv:1906.03897
Author: Yoav Kantor
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03897
 Abstract: The field of Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) has produced various systems to deal with focused phenomena or general text editing. We propose an automatic way to combine black-box systems. Our method automatically detects the strength of a system or the combination of several systems per error type, improving precision and recall while optimizing $F$ score directly. We show consistent improvement over the best standalone system in all the configurations tested. This approach also outperforms average ensembling of different RNN models with random initializations. In addition, we analyze the use of BERT for GEC - reporting promising results on this end. We also present a spellchecker created for this task which outperforms standard spellcheckers tested on the task of spellchecking. This paper describes a system submission to Building Educational Applications 2019 Shared Task: Grammatical Error Correction. Combining the output of top BEA 2019 shared task systems using our approach, currently holds the highest reported score in the open phase of the BEA 2019 shared task, improving F0.5 by 3.7 points over the best result reported. 

108__ Goodness-of-fit Test for Latent Block Models__arXiv:1906.03886
Author: Chihiro Watanabe
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03886
 Abstract: Latent Block Models are used for probabilistic biclustering, which is shown to be an effective method for analyzing various relational data sets. However, there has been no statistical test method for determining the row and column cluster numbers of Latent Block Models. Recent studies have constructed statistical-test-based methods for Stochastic Block Models, in which we assume that the observed matrix is a square symmetric matrix and that the cluster assignments are the same for rows and columns. In this paper, we develop a goodness-of-fit test for Latent Block Models, which tests whether an observed data matrix fits a given set of row and column cluster numbers, or it consists of more clusters in at least one direction of row and column. To construct the test method, we use a result from random matrix theory for a sample covariance matrix. We show experimentally the effectiveness of our proposed method, by showing the asymptotic behavior of the test statistic and the test accuracy. 

109__ Scale Steerable Filters for Locally Scale-Invariant Convolutional Neural  Networks__arXiv:1906.03861
Author: Rohan Ghosh
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03861
 Abstract: Augmenting transformation knowledge onto a convolutional neural network's weights has often yielded significant improvements in performance. For rotational transformation augmentation, an important element to recent approaches has been the use of a steerable basis i.e. the circular harmonics. Here, we propose a scale-steerable filter basis for the locally scale-invariant CNN, denoted as log-radial harmonics. By replacing the kernels in the locally scale-invariant CNN \cite{lsi_cnn} with scale-steered kernels, significant improvements in performance can be observed on the MNIST-Scale and FMNIST-Scale datasets. Training with a scale-steerable basis results in filters which show meaningful structure, and feature maps demonstrate which demonstrate visibly higher spatial-structure preservation of input. Furthermore, the proposed scale-steerable CNN shows on-par generalization to global affine transformation estimation methods such as Spatial Transformers, in response to test-time data distortions. 

110__ Bayesian Automatic Relevance Determination for Utility Function  Specification in Discrete Choice Models__arXiv:1906.03855
Author: Filipe Rodrigues
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03855
 Abstract: Specifying utility functions is a key step towards applying the discrete choice framework for understanding the behaviour processes that govern user choices. However, identifying the utility function specifications that best model and explain the observed choices can be a very challenging and time-consuming task. This paper seeks to help modellers by leveraging the Bayesian framework and the concept of automatic relevance determination (ARD), in order to automatically determine an optimal utility function specification from an exponentially large set of possible specifications in a purely data-driven manner. Based on recent advances in approximate Bayesian inference, a doubly stochastic variational inference is developed, which allows the proposed DCM-ARD model to scale to very large and high-dimensional datasets. Using semi-artificial choice data, the proposed approach is shown to very accurately recover the true utility function specifications that govern the observed choices. Moreover, when applied to real choice data, DCM-ARD is shown to be able discover high quality specifications that can outperform previous ones from the literature according to multiple criteria, thereby demonstrating its practical applicability. 

111__ Learning Dense Physical Object Representations via  Multi-step Dynamic Interactions__arXiv:1906.03853
Author: Zhenjia Xu
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03853
 Abstract: We study the problem of learning physical object representations for robot manipulation. Understanding object physics is critical for successful object manipulation, but also challenging because physical object properties can rarely be inferred from the object's static appearance. In this paper, we propose \model, a system that actively executes a sequence of dynamic interactions (\eg, sliding and colliding), and uses a deep predictive model over its visual observations to learn dense, pixel-wise representations that reflect the physical properties of observed objects. Our experiments in both simulation and real settings demonstrate that the learned representations carry rich physical information, and can directly be used to decode physical object properties such as friction and mass. The use of dense representation enables \model to generalize well to novel scenes with more objects than in training. With knowledge of object physics, the learned representation also leads to more accurate and efficient manipulation in downstream tasks than the state-of-the-art.

 Abstract: Enabling a machine to read and comprehend the natural language documents so that it can answer some questions remains an elusive challenge. In recent years, the popularity of deep learning and the establishment of large-scale datasets have both promoted the prosperity of Machine Reading Comprehension.

Further, we also point out the defects of existing models and future research directions 

113__ Learned Conjugate Gradient Descent Network for Massive MIMO Detection__arXiv:1906.03814
Author: Yi Wei
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03814
 Abstract: In this work, we consider the use of model-driven deep learning techniques for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detection. Compared with conventional MIMO systems, massive MIMO promises improved spectral efficiency, coverage and range. Unfortunately, these benefits are coming at the cost of significantly increased computational complexity. To reduce the complexity of signal detection and guarantee the performance, we present a learned conjugate gradient descent network (LcgNet), which is constructed by unfolding the iterative conjugate gradient descent (CG) detector. In the proposed network, instead of calculating the exact values of the scalar step-sizes, we explicitly learn their universal values. Also, we can enhance the proposed network by augmenting the dimensions of these step-sizes. Furthermore, in order to reduce the memory costs, a novel quantized LcgNet is proposed, where a low-resolution nonuniform quantizer is integrated into the LcgNet to smartly quantize the aforementioned step-sizes. The quantizer is based on a specially designed soft staircase function with learnable parameters to adjust its shape. Meanwhile, due to fact that the number of learnable parameters is limited, the proposed networks are easy and fast to train. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed network can achieve promising performance with much lower complexity. 

114__ Sampling Humans for Optimizing Preferences in Coloring Artwork__arXiv:1906.03813
Author: Michael McCourt
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03813
 Abstract: Many circumstances of practical importance have performance or success metrics which exist implicitly---in the eye of the beholder, so to speak. Tuning aspects of such problems requires working without defined metrics and only considering pairwise comparisons or rankings. In this paper, we review an existing Bayesian optimization strategy for determining most-preferred outcomes, and identify an adaptation to allow it to handle ties. We then discuss some of the issues we have encountered when humans use this optimization strategy to optimize coloring a piece of abstract artwork. We hope that, by participating in this workshop, we can learn how other researchers encounter difficulties unique to working with humans in the loop. 

115__ Multiway clustering via tensor block models__arXiv:1906.03807
Author: Yuchen Zeng
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03807
 Abstract: We consider the problem of identifying multiway block structure from a large noisy tensor. Such problems arise frequently in applications such as genomics, recommendation system, topic modeling, and sensor network localization. We propose a tensor block model, develop a unified least-square estimation, and obtain the theoretical accuracy guarantees for multiway clustering. The statistical convergence of the estimator is established, and we show that the associated clustering procedure achieves partition consistency. A sparse regularization is further developed for identifying important blocks with elevated means. The proposal handles a broad range of data types, including binary, continuous, and hybrid observations. Through simulation and application to two real datasets, we demonstrate the outperformance of our approach over previous methods. 

116__ The Broad Optimality of Profile Maximum Likelihood__arXiv:1906.03794
Author: Yi Hao
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03794
 Abstract: We study three fundamental statistical-learning problems: distribution estimation, property estimation, and property testing. We establish the profile maximum likelihood (PML) estimator as the first unified sample-optimal approach to a wide range of learning tasks. In particular, for every alphabet size $k$ and desired accuracy $\varepsilon$: $\textbf{Distribution estimation}$ Under $\ell_1$ distance, PML yields optimal $\Theta(k/(\varepsilon^2\log k))$ sample complexity for sorted-distribution estimation, and a PML-based estimator empirically outperforms the Good-Turing estimator on the actual distribution; $\textbf{Additive property estimation}$ For a broad class of additive properties, the PML plug-in estimator uses just four times the sample size required by the best estimator to achieve roughly twice its error, with exponentially higher confidence; $\boldsymbol{\alpha}\textbf{-R\'enyi entropy estimation}$ For an integer $\alpha>1$, the PML plug-in estimator has optimal $k^{1-1/\alpha}$ sample complexity; for non-integer $\alpha>3/4$, the PML plug-in estimator has sample complexity lower than the state of the art; $\textbf{Identity testing}$ In testing whether an unknown distribution is equal to or at least $\varepsilon$ far from a given distribution in $\ell_1$ distance, a PML-based tester achieves the optimal sample complexity up to logarithmic factors of $k$. With minor modifications, most of these results also hold for a near-linear-time computable variant of PML. 

117__ A Regression Approach to Certain Information Transmission Problems__arXiv:1906.03777
Author: Wenyi Zhang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03777
 Abstract: A general information transmission model, under independent and identically distributed Gaussian codebook and nearest neighbor decoding rule with processed channel output, is investigated using the performance metric of generalized mutual information. When the encoder and the decoder know the statistical channel model, it is found that the optimal channel output processing function is the conditional expectation operator, thus hinting a potential role of regression, a classical topic in machine learning, for this model. Without utilizing the statistical channel model, a problem formulation inspired by machine learning principles is established, with suitable performance metrics introduced. A data-driven inference algorithm is proposed to solve the problem, and the effectiveness of the algorithm is validated via numerical experiments. Extensions to more general information transmission models are also discussed. 

118__ A cost-reducing partial labeling estimator in text classification  problem__arXiv:1906.03768
Author: Jiangning Chen
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03768
 Abstract: We propose a new approach to address the text classification problems when learning with partial labels is beneficial. Instead of offering each training sample a set of candidate labels, we assign negative-oriented labels to the ambiguous training examples if they are unlikely fall into certain classes. We construct our new maximum likelihood estimators with self-correction property, and prove that under some conditions, our estimators converge faster. Also we discuss the advantages of applying one of our estimator to a fully supervised learning problem. The proposed method has potential applicability in many areas, such as crowdsourcing, natural language processing and medical image analysis. 

119__ The Impact of Regularization on High-dimensional Logistic Regression__arXiv:1906.03761
Author: Fariborz Salehi
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03761
 Abstract: Logistic regression is commonly used for modeling dichotomous outcomes. In the classical setting, where the number of observations is much larger than the number of parameters, properties of the maximum likelihood estimator in logistic regression are well understood. Recently, Sur and Candes have studied logistic regression in the high-dimensional regime, where the number of observations and parameters are comparable, and show, among other things, that the maximum likelihood estimator is biased. In the high-dimensional regime the underlying parameter vector is often structured (sparse, block-sparse, finite-alphabet, etc.) and so in this paper we study regularized logistic regression (RLR), where a convex regularizer that encourages the desired structure is added to the negative of the log-likelihood function. An advantage of RLR is that it allows parameter recovery even for instances where the (unconstrained) maximum likelihood estimate does not exist. We provide a precise analysis of the performance of RLR via the solution of a system of six nonlinear equations, through which any performance metric of interest (mean, mean-squared error, probability of support recovery, etc.) can be explicitly computed. Our results generalize those of Sur and Candes and we provide a detailed study for the cases of $\ell_2^2$-RLR and sparse ($\ell_1$-regularized) logistic regression. In both cases, we obtain explicit expressions for various performance metrics and can find the values of the regularizer parameter that optimizes the desired performance. The theory is validated by extensive numerical simulations across a range of parameter values and problem instances. 

120__ A Large-Scale Dataset for Abstractive and Coherent  Summarization__arXiv:1906.03741
Author: Eva Sharma
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03741
 Abstract: Most existing text summarization datasets are compiled from the news domain, where summaries have a flattened discourse structure. In such datasets, summary-worthy content often appears in the beginning of input articles. Moreover, large segments from input articles are present verbatim in their respective summaries. These issues impede the learning and evaluation of systems that can understand an article's global content structure as well as produce abstractive summaries with high compression ratio. In this work, we present a novel dataset, BIGPATENT, consisting of 1.3 million records of U.S. patent documents along with human written abstractive summaries. Compared to existing summarization datasets, BIGPATENT has the following properties: i) summaries contain a richer discourse structure with more recurring entities, ii) salient content is evenly distributed in the input, and iii) lesser and shorter extractive fragments are present in the summaries. Finally, we train and evaluate baselines and popular learning models on BIGPATENT to shed light on new challenges and motivate future directions for summarization research. 

121__ Integrative Factorization of Bidimensionally Linked Matrices__arXiv:1906.03722
Author: Jun Young Park
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03722
 Abstract: Advances in molecular "omics'" technologies have motivated new methodology for the integration of multiple sources of high-content biomedical data. However, most statistical methods for integrating multiple data matrices only consider data shared vertically (one cohort on multiple platforms) or horizontally (different cohorts on a single platform). This is limiting for data that take the form of bidimensionally linked matrices (e.g., multiple cohorts measured on multiple platforms), which are increasingly common in large-scale biomedical studies. In this paper, we propose BIDIFAC (Bidimensional Integrative Factorization) for integrative dimension reduction and signal approximation of bidimensionally linked data matrices. Our method factorizes the data into (i) globally shared, (ii) row-shared, (iii) column-shared, and (iv) single-matrix structural components, facilitating the investigation of shared and unique patterns of variability. For estimation we use a penalized objective function that extends the nuclear norm penalization for a single matrix. As an alternative to the complicated rank selection problem, we use results from random matrix theory to choose tuning parameters. We apply our method to integrate two genomics platforms (mRNA and miRNA expression) across two sample cohorts (tumor samples and normal tissue samples) using the breast cancer data from TCGA.

Author: Mateusz Buda
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03720
 Abstract: Recent analysis identified distinct genomic subtypes of lower-grade glioma tumors which are associated with shape features. In this study, we propose a fully automatic way to quantify tumor imaging characteristics using deep learning-based segmentation and test whether these characteristics are predictive of tumor genomic subtypes. We used preoperative imaging and genomic data of 110 patients from 5 institutions with lower-grade gliomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Based on automatic deep learning segmentations, we extracted three features which quantify two-dimensional and three-dimensional characteristics of the tumors. Genomic data for the analyzed cohort of patients consisted of previously identified genomic clusters based on IDH mutation and 1p/19q co-deletion, DNA methylation, gene expression, DNA copy number, and microRNA expression. To analyze the relationship between the imaging features and genomic clusters, we conducted the Fisher exact test for 10 hypotheses for each pair of imaging feature and genomic subtype. To account for multiple hypothesis testing, we applied a Bonferroni correction. P-values lower than 0.005 were considered statistically significant. We found the strongest association between RNASeq clusters and the bounding ellipsoid volume ratio ($p<0.0002$) and between RNASeq clusters and margin fluctuation ($p<0.005$). In addition, we identified associations between bounding ellipsoid volume ratio and all tested molecular subtypes ($p<0.02$) as well as between angular standard deviation and RNASeq cluster ($p<0.02$). In terms of automatic tumor segmentation that was used to generate the quantitative image characteristics, our deep learning algorithm achieved a mean Dice coefficient of 82% which is comparable to human performance. 

123__ Gendered Pronoun Resolution using BERT and an extractive question  answering formulation__arXiv:1906.03695
Author: Rakesh Chada
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03695
 Abstract: The resolution of ambiguous pronouns is a longstanding challenge in Natural Language Understanding. Recent studies have suggested gender bias among state-of-the-art coreference resolution systems. As an example, Google AI Language team recently released a gender-balanced dataset and showed that performance of these coreference resolvers is significantly limited on the dataset. In this paper, we propose an extractive question answering (QA) formulation of pronoun resolution task that overcomes this limitation and shows much lower gender bias (0.99) on their dataset. This system uses fine-tuned representations from the pre-trained BERT model and outperforms the existing baseline by a significant margin (22.2% absolute improvement in F1 score) without using any hand-engineered features. This QA framework is equally performant even without the knowledge of the candidate antecedents of the pronoun. An ensemble of QA and BERT-based multiple choice and sequence classification models further improves the F1 (23.3% absolute improvement upon the baseline). This ensemble model was submitted to the shared task for the 1st ACL workshop on Gender Bias for Natural Language Processing. It ranked 9th on the final official leaderboard.

124__ Interpreting Age Effects of Human Fetal Brain from Spontaneous fMRI  using Deep 3D Convolutional Neural Networks__arXiv:1906.03691
Author: Xiangrui Li
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03691
 Abstract: Understanding human fetal neurodevelopment is of great clinical importance as abnormal development is linked to adverse neuropsychiatric outcomes after birth. Recent advances in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) have provided new insight into development of the human brain before birth, but these studies have predominately focused on brain functional connectivity (i.e. Fisher z-score), which requires manual processing steps for feature extraction from fMRI images. Deep learning approaches (i.e., Convolutional Neural Networks) have achieved remarkable success on learning directly from image data, yet have not been applied on fetal fMRI for understanding fetal neurodevelopment. Here, we bridge this gap by applying a novel application of deep 3D CNN to fetal blood oxygen-level dependence (BOLD) resting-state fMRI data. Specifically, we test a supervised CNN framework as a data-driven approach to isolate variation in fMRI signals that relate to younger v.s. older fetal age groups. Based on the learned CNN, we further perform sensitivity analysis to identify brain regions in which changes in BOLD signal are strongly associated with fetal brain age. The findings demonstrate that deep CNNs are a promising approach for identifying spontaneous functional patterns in fetal brain activity that discriminate age groups. Further, we discovered that regions that most strongly differentiate groups are largely bilateral, share similar distribution in older and younger age groups, and are areas of heightened metabolic activity in early human development. 

125__ An Attention-based Recurrent Convolutional Network for Vehicle Taillight  Recognition__arXiv:1906.03683
Author: Kuan-Hui Lee
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03683
 Abstract: Vehicle taillight recognition is an important application for automated driving, especially for intent prediction of ado vehicles and trajectory planning of the ego vehicle. In this work, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework to recognize taillights, i.e. rear turn and brake signals, from a sequence of images. The proposed method starts with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract spatial features, and then applies a Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) to learn temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we integrate attention models in both spatial and temporal domains, where the attention models learn to selectively focus on both spatial and temporal features. Our method is able to outperform the state of the art in terms of accuracy on the UC Merced Vehicle Rear Signal Dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of attention models for vehicle taillight recognition. 

126__ LSTM Networks Can Perform Dynamic Counting__arXiv:1906.03648
Author: Mirac Suzgun
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03648
 Abstract: In this paper, we systematically assess the ability of standard recurrent networks to perform dynamic counting and to encode hierarchical representations. All the neural models in our experiments are designed to be small-sized networks both to prevent them from memorizing the training sets and to visualize and interpret their behaviour at test time. Our results demonstrate that the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks can learn to recognize the well-balanced parenthesis language (Dyck-$1$) and the shuffles of multiple Dyck-$1$ languages, each defined over different parenthesis-pairs, by emulating simple real-time $k$-counter machines. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first study to introduce the shuffle languages to analyze the computational power of neural networks. We also show that a single-layer LSTM with only one hidden unit is practically sufficient for recognizing the Dyck-$1$ language. However, none of our recurrent networks was able to yield a good performance on the Dyck-$2$ language learning task, which requires a model to have a stack-like mechanism for recognition. 

127__ A Variant of Gaussian Process Dynamical Systems__arXiv:1906.03647
Author: Jing Zhao
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03647
 Abstract: In order to better model high-dimensional sequential data, we propose a collaborative multi-output Gaussian process dynamical system (CGPDS), which is a novel variant of GPDSs. The proposed model assumes that the output on each dimension is controlled by a shared global latent process and a private local latent process. Thus, the dependence among different dimensions of the sequences can be captured, and the unique characteristics of each dimension of the sequences can be maintained. For training models and making prediction, we introduce inducing points and adopt stochastic variational inference methods. 

128__ The Implicit Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm__arXiv:1906.03644
Author: Kirill Neklyudov
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03644
 Abstract: Recent works propose using the discriminator of a GAN to filter out unrealistic samples of the generator. We generalize these ideas by introducing the implicit Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. For any implicit probabilistic model and a target distribution represented by a set of samples, implicit Metropolis-Hastings operates by learning a discriminator to estimate the density-ratio and then generating a chain of samples. Since the approximation of density ratio introduces an error on every step of the chain, it is crucial to analyze the stationary distribution of such chain. For that purpose, we present a theoretical result stating that the discriminator loss upper bounds the total variation distance between the target distribution and the stationary distribution. Finally, we validate the proposed algorithm both for independent and Markov proposals on CIFAR-10 and CelebA datasets. 

129__ Consensus Neural Network for Medical Imaging Denoising with Only Noisy  Training Samples__arXiv:1906.03639
Author: Dufan Wu
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03639
 Abstract: Deep neural networks have been proved efficient for medical image denoising. Current training methods require both noisy and clean images. However, clean images cannot be acquired for many practical medical applications due to naturally noisy signal, such as dynamic imaging, spectral computed tomography, arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging, etc. In this paper we proposed a training method which learned denoising neural networks from noisy training samples only. Training data in the acquisition domain was split to two subsets and the network was trained to map one noisy set to the other. A consensus loss function was further proposed to efficiently combine the outputs from both subsets. A mathematical proof was provided that the proposed training scheme was equivalent to training with noisy and clean samples when the noise in the two subsets was uncorrelated and zero-mean. The method was validated on Low-dose CT Challenge dataset and NYU MRI dataset and achieved improved performance compared to existing unsupervised methods. 

130__ Deep Music Analogy Via Latent Representation Disentanglement__arXiv:1906.03626
Author: Ruihan Yang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03626
 Abstract: Analogy is a key solution to automated music generation, featured by its ability to generate both natural and creative pieces based on only a few examples. In general, an analogy is made by partially transferring the music abstractions, i.e., high-level representations and their relationships, from one piece to another; however, this procedure requires disentangling music representations, which takes little effort for musicians but is non-trivial for computers. Three sub-problems arise: extracting latent representations from the observation, disentangling the representations so that each part has a unique semantic interpretation, and mapping the latent representations back to actual music. An explicitly-constrained conditional variational auto-encoder (EC2-VAE) is proposed as a unified solution to all three sub-problems. In this study, we focus on disentangling the pitch and rhythm representations of 8-beat music clips conditioned on chords. In producing music analogies, this model helps us to realize the imaginary situation of "what if" a piece is composed using a different pitch contour, rhythm pattern, chord progression etc., by borrowing the representations from other pieces. Finally, we validate the proposed disentanglement method using objective measurements and evaluate the analogy examples by a subjective study. 

131__ Distilling Object Detectors with Fine-grained Feature Imitation__arXiv:1906.03609
Author: Tao Wang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03609
 Abstract: State-of-the-art CNN based recognition models are often computationally prohibitive to deploy on low-end devices. A promising high level approach tackling this limitation is knowledge distillation, which let small student model mimic cumbersome teacher model's output to get improved generalization. However, related methods mainly focus on simple task of classification while do not consider complex tasks like object detection. We show applying the vanilla knowledge distillation to detection model gets minor gain. To address the challenge of distilling knowledge in detection model, we propose a fine-grained feature imitation method exploiting the cross-location discrepancy of feature response. Our intuition is that detectors care more about local near object regions. Thus the discrepancy of feature response on the near object anchor locations reveals important information of how teacher model tends to generalize. We design a novel mechanism to estimate those locations and let student model imitate the teacher on them to get enhanced performance. We first validate the idea on a developed lightweight toy detector which carries simplest notion of current state-of-the-art anchor based detection models on challenging KITTI dataset, our method generates up to 15% boost of mAP for the student model compared to the non-imitated counterpart. We then extensively evaluate the method with Faster R-CNN model under various scenarios with common object detection benchmark of Pascal VOC and COCO, imitation alleviates up to 74% performance drop of student model compared to teacher.

132__ Diagnosing the Meaning Content of Word  Embeddings__arXiv:1906.03608
Author: Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03608
 Abstract: Word embeddings typically represent different meanings of a word in a single conflated vector. Empirical analysis of embeddings of ambiguous words is currently limited by the small size of manually annotated resources and by the fact that word senses are treated as unrelated individual concepts. We present a large dataset based on manual Wikipedia annotations and word senses, where word senses from different words are related by semantic classes. This is the basis for novel diagnostic tests for an embedding's content: we probe word embeddings for semantic classes and analyze the embedding space by classifying embeddings into semantic classes. Our main findings are: (i) Information about a sense is generally represented well in a single-vector embedding - if the sense is frequent. (ii) A classifier can accurately predict whether a word is single-sense or multi-sense, based only on its embedding. (iii) Although rare senses are not well represented in single-vector embeddings, this does not have negative impact on an NLP application whose performance depends on frequent senses. 

133__ A Survey on Neural Network Language Models__arXiv:1906.03591

PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03591
 Abstract: As the core component of Natural Language Processing (NLP) system, Language Model (LM) can provide word representation and probability indication of word sequences. Neural Network Language Models (NNLMs) overcome the curse of dimensionality and improve the performance of traditional LMs. A survey on NNLMs is performed in this paper. The structure of classic NNLMs is described firstly, and then some major improvements are introduced and analyzed. We summarize and compare corpora and toolkits of NNLMs. Further, some research directions of NNLMs are discussed. 

134__ Theoretical Framework and Off-line  Study__arXiv:1906.03590
Author: Chao Zhai
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03590
 Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework to construct the region of attraction (ROA) of a power system centered around a stable equilibrium by using stable state trajectories of system dynamics. Most existing works on estimating ROA rely on analytical Lyapunov functions, which are subject to two limitations: the analytic Lyapunov functions may not be always readily available, and the resulting ROA may be overly conservative. This work overcomes these two limitations by leveraging the converse Lyapunov theorem in control theory to eliminate the need of an analytic Lyapunov function and learning the unknown Lyapunov function with the Gaussian Process (GP) approach. In addition, a Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound (GP-UCB) based sampling algorithm is designed to reconcile the trade-off between the exploitation for enlarging the ROA and the exploration for reducing the uncertainty of sampling region. Within the constructed ROA, it is guaranteed in probability that the system state will converge to the stable equilibrium with a confidence level. Numerical simulations are also conducted to validate the assessment approach for the ROA of the single machine infinite bus system and the New England $39$-bus system. Numerical results demonstrate that our approach can significantly enlarge the estimated ROA compared to that of the analytic Lyapunov counterpart. 

135__ An Unsupervised Segment-Based Robust Voice Activity Detection  Method__arXiv:1906.03588
Author: Zheng-Hua Tan
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03588
 Abstract: This paper presents an unsupervised segment-based method for robust voice activity detection (rVAD). The method consists of two passes of denoising followed by a voice activity detection (VAD) stage. In the first pass, high-energy segments in a speech signal are detected by using a posteriori signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) weighted energy difference and if no pitch is detected within a segment, the segment is considered as a high-energy noise segment and set to zero. In the second pass, the speech signal is denoised by a speech enhancement method, for which several methods are explored. Next, neighbouring frames with pitch are grouped together to form pitch segments, and based on speech statistics, the pitch segments are further extended from both ends in order to include both voiced and unvoiced sounds and likely non-speech parts as well. In the end, a posteriori SNR weighted energy difference is applied to the extended pitch segments of the denoised speech signal for detecting voice activity. We evaluate the VAD performance of the proposed method using two databases, RATS and Aurora-2, which contain a large variety of noise conditions. The rVAD method is further evaluated, in terms of speaker verification performance, on the RedDots 2016 challenge database and its noise-corrupted versions. Experiment results show that rVAD is compared favourably with a number of existing methods. In addition, we present a modified version of rVAD where computationally intensive pitch extraction is replaced by computationally efficient spectral flatness calculation. The modified version significantly reduces the computational complexity at the cost of moderately inferior VAD performance, which is an advantage when processing a large amount of data and running on low resource devices. The source code of rVAD is made publicly available. 

136__ Stochastic In-Face Frank-Wolfe Methods for Non-Convex Optimization and  Sparse Neural Network Training__arXiv:1906.03580
Author: Paul Grigas
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03580
 Abstract: The Frank-Wolfe method and its extensions are well-suited for delivering solutions with desirable structural properties, such as sparsity or low-rank structure. We introduce a new variant of the Frank-Wolfe method that combines Frank-Wolfe steps and steepest descent steps, as well as a novel modification of the "Frank-Wolfe gap" to measure convergence in the non-convex case. We further extend this method to incorporate in-face directions for preserving structured solutions as well as block coordinate steps, and we demonstrate computational guarantees in terms of the modified Frank-Wolfe gap for all of these variants. We are particularly motivated by the application of this methodology to the training of neural networks with sparse properties, and we apply our block coordinate method to the problem of $\ell_1$ regularized neural network training. We present the results of several numerical experiments on both artificial and real datasets demonstrating significant improvements of our method in training sparse neural networks. 

137__ Robust conditional GANs under missing or uncertain labels__arXiv:1906.03579
Author: Kiran Koshy Thekumparampil
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03579
 Abstract: Matching the performance of conditional Generative Adversarial Networks with little supervision is an important task, especially in venturing into new domains. We design a new training algorithm, which is robust to missing or ambiguous labels. The main idea is to intentionally corrupt the labels of generated examples to match the statistics of the real data, and have a discriminator process the real and generated examples with corrupted labels. We showcase the robustness of this proposed approach both theoretically and empirically. We show that minimizing the proposed loss is equivalent to minimizing true divergence between real and generated data up to a multiplicative factor, and characterize this multiplicative factor as a function of the statistics of the uncertain labels. Experiments on MNIST dataset demonstrates that proposed architecture is able to achieve high accuracy in generating examples faithful to the class even with only a few examples per class. 

138__ The Implicit Bias of AdaGrad on Separable Data__arXiv:1906.03559
Author: Qian Qian
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03559
 Abstract: We study the implicit bias of AdaGrad on separable linear classification problems. We show that AdaGrad converges to a direction that can be characterized as the solution of a quadratic optimization problem with the same feasible set as the hard SVM problem. We also give a discussion about how different choices of the hyperparameters of AdaGrad might impact this direction. This provides a deeper understanding of why adaptive methods do not seem to have the generalization ability as good as gradient descent does in practice. 

139__ In Situ Cane Toad Recognition__arXiv:1906.03547
Author: Dmitry A. Konovalov
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03547
 Abstract: Cane toads are invasive, toxic to native predators, compete with native insectivores, and have a devastating impact on Australian ecosystems, prompting the Australian government to list toads as a key threatening process under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Mechanical cane toad traps could be made more native-fauna friendly if they could distinguish invasive cane toads from native species. Here we designed and trained a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) starting from the Xception CNN. The XToadGmp toad-recognition CNN we developed was trained end-to-end using heat-map Gaussian targets. After training, XToadGmp required minimum image pre/post-processing and when tested on 720x1280 shaped images, it achieved 97.1% classification accuracy on 1863 toad and 2892 not-toad test images, which were not used in training. 

140__ Guidelines for Responsible and Human-Centered Use of Explainable Machine  Learning__arXiv:1906.03533
Author: Patrick Hall
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03533
 Abstract: Explainable machine learning (ML) has been implemented in numerous open source and proprietary software packages and explainable ML is an important aspect of commercial predictive modeling. However, explainable ML can be misused, particularly as a faulty safeguard for harmful black-boxes, e.g. fairwashing, and for other malevolent purposes like model stealing. This text discusses definitions, examples, and guidelines that promote a holistic and human-centered approach to ML which includes interpretable (i.e. white-box ) models and explanatory, debugging, and disparate impact analysis techniques. 

141__ Domain Adaptive Dialog Generation via Meta Learning__arXiv:1906.03520
Author: Kun Qian
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03520
 Abstract: Domain adaptation is an essential task in dialog system building because there are so many new dialog tasks created for different needs every day. Collecting and annotating training data for these new tasks is costly since it involves real user interactions. We propose a domain adaptive dialog generation method based on meta-learning (DAML). DAML is an end-to-end trainable dialog system model that learns from multiple rich-resource tasks and then adapts to new domains with minimal training samples. We train a dialog system model using multiple rich-resource single-domain dialog data by applying the model-agnostic meta-learning algorithm to dialog domain. The model is capable of learning a competitive dialog system on a new domain with only a few training examples in an efficient manner. The two-step gradient updates in DAML enable the model to learn general features across multiple tasks. We evaluate our method on a simulated dialog dataset and achieve state-of-the-art performance, which is generalizable to new tasks. 

142__ Dimension-wise Convolutions for Efficient Networks__arXiv:1906.03516
Author: Sachin Mehta
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03516
 Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new CNN model DiCENet, that is built using: (1) dimension-wise convolutions and (2) efficient channel fusion. The introduced blocks maximize the use of information in the input tensor by learning representations across all dimensions while simultaneously reducing the complexity of the network and achieving high accuracy. Our model shows significant improvements over state-of-the-art models across various visual recognition tasks, including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Our model delivers either the same or better performance than existing models with fewer FLOPs, including task-specific models. Notably, DiCENet delivers competitive performance to neural architecture search-based methods at fewer FLOPs (70-100 MFLOPs). On the MS-COCO object detection, DiCENet is 4.5% more accurate and has 5.6 times fewer FLOPs than YOLOv2. On the PASCAL VOC 2012 semantic segmentation dataset, DiCENet is 4.3% more accurate and has 3.2 times fewer FLOPs than a recent efficient semantic segmentation network, ESPNet.

143__ Forward and Backward Knowledge Transfer for Sentiment Classification__arXiv:1906.03506
Author: Hao Wang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03506
 Abstract: This paper studies the problem of learning a sequence of sentiment classification tasks. The learned knowledge from each task is retained and used to help future or subsequent task learning. This learning paradigm is called Lifelong Learning (LL). However, existing LL methods either only transfer knowledge forward to help future learning and do not go back to improve the model of a previous task or require the training data of the previous task to retrain its model to exploit backward/reverse knowledge transfer. This paper studies reverse knowledge transfer of LL in the context of naive Bayesian (NB) classification. It aims to improve the model of a previous task by leveraging future knowledge without retraining using its training data. This is done by exploiting a key characteristic of the generative model of NB. That is, it is possible to improve the NB classifier for a task by improving its model parameters directly by using the retained knowledge from other tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method markedly outperforms existing LL baselines. 

144__ Attending to Discriminative Certainty for Domain Adaptation__arXiv:1906.03502
Author: Vinod Kumar Kurmi
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03502
 Abstract: In this paper, we aim to solve for unsupervised domain adaptation of classifiers where we have access to label information for the source domain while these are not available for a target domain. While various methods have been proposed for solving these including adversarial discriminator based methods, most approaches have focused on the entire image based domain adaptation. In an image, there would be regions that can be adapted better, for instance, the foreground object may be similar in nature. To obtain such regions, we propose methods that consider the probabilistic certainty estimate of various regions and specify focus on these during classification for adaptation. We observe that just by incorporating the probabilistic certainty of the discriminator while training the classifier, we are able to obtain state of the art results on various datasets as compared against all the recent methods. We provide a thorough empirical analysis of the method by providing ablation analysis, statistical significance test, and visualization of the attention maps and t-SNE embeddings. These evaluations convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 

145__ Adversarial Mahalanobis Distance-based Attentive Song Recommender for  Automatic Playlist Continuation__arXiv:1906.03450
Author: Thanh Tran
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03450
 Abstract: In this paper, we aim to solve the automatic playlist continuation (APC) problem by modeling complex interactions among users, playlists, and songs using only their interaction data. Prior methods mainly rely on dot product to account for similarities, which is not ideal as dot product is not metric learning, so it does not convey the important inequality property. Based on this observation, we propose three novel deep learning approaches that utilize Mahalanobis distance. Our first approach uses user-playlist-song interactions, and combines Mahalanobis distance scores between (i) a target user and a target song, and (ii) between a target playlist and the target song to account for both the user's preference and the playlist's theme. Our second approach measures song-song similarities by considering Mahalanobis distance scores between the target song and each member song (i.e., existing song) in the target playlist. The contribution of each distance score is measured by our proposed memory metric-based attention mechanism. In the third approach, we fuse the two previous models into a unified model to further enhance their performance. In addition, we adopt and customize Adversarial Personalized Ranking (APR) for our three approaches to further improve their robustness and predictive capabilities. Through extensive experiments, we show that our proposed models outperform eight state-of-the-art models in two large-scale real-world datasets. 

146__ Real or Fake?__arXiv:1906.03423
Author: Maryam Ramezani
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03423
 Abstract: Making disguise between real and fake news propagation through online social networks is an important issue in many applications. The time gap between the news release time and detection of its label is a significant step towards broadcasting the real information and avoiding the fake. Therefore, one of the challenging tasks in this area is to identify fake and real news in early stages of propagation. However, there is a trade-off between minimizing the time gap and maximizing accuracy. Despite recent efforts in detection of fake news, there has been no significant work that explicitly incorporates early detection in its model. In this paper, we focus on accurate early labeling of news, and propose a model by considering earliness both in modeling and prediction. The proposed method utilizes recurrent neural networks with a novel loss function, and a new stopping rule. Given the context of news, we first embed it with a class-specific text representation. Then, we utilize the available public profile of users, and speed of news diffusion, for early labeling of the news. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model both in terms of early labelling and accuracy, compared to the state of the art baseline and models. 

147__ Class-specific Differential Detection in Diffractive Optical Neural  Networks Improves Inference Accuracy__arXiv:1906.03417
Author: Jingxi Li
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03417
 Abstract: Diffractive deep neural networks have been introduced earlier as an optical machine learning framework that uses task-specific diffractive surfaces designed by deep learning to all-optically perform inference, achieving promising performance for object classification and imaging. Here we demonstrate systematic improvements in diffractive optical neural networks based on a differential measurement technique that mitigates the non-negativity constraint of light intensity. In this scheme, each class is assigned to a separate pair of photodetectors, behind a diffractive network, and the class inference is made by maximizing the normalized signal difference between the detector pairs. Moreover, by utilizing the inherent parallelization capability of optical systems, we reduced the signal coupling between the positive and negative detectors of each class by dividing their optical path into two jointly-trained diffractive neural networks that work in parallel. We further made use of this parallelization approach, and divided individual classes among multiple jointly-trained differential diffractive neural networks. Using this class-specific differential detection in jointly-optimized diffractive networks, our simulations achieved testing accuracies of 98.52%, 91.48% and 50.82% for MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and grayscale CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively. Similar to ensemble methods practiced in machine learning, we also independently-optimized multiple differential diffractive networks that optically project their light onto a common detector plane, and achieved testing accuracies of 98.59%, 91.06% and 51.44% for MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and grayscale CIFAR-10, respectively. Through these systematic advances in designing diffractive neural networks, the reported classification accuracies set the state-of-the-art for an all-optical neural network design. 

148__ Effective Use of Variational Embedding Capacity in Expressive End-to-End  Speech Synthesis__arXiv:1906.03402
Author: Eric Battenberg
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03402
 Abstract: Recent work has explored sequence-to-sequence latent variable models for expressive speech synthesis (supporting control and transfer of prosody and style), but has not presented a coherent framework for understanding the trade-offs between the competing methods. In this paper, we propose embedding capacity as a unified method of analyzing the behavior of latent variable models of speech, comparing existing heuristic (non-variational) methods to variational methods that are able to explicitly constrain capacity using an upper bound on representational mutual information. In our proposed model, we show that by adding conditional dependencies to the variational posterior such that it matches the form of the true posterior, the same model can be used for high-precision prosody transfer, text-agnostic style transfer, and generation of natural-sounding prior samples. For multi-speaker models, the proposed model is able to preserve target speaker identity during inter-speaker prosody transfer and when drawing samples from the latent prior. Lastly, we introduce a method for decomposing embedding capacity hierarchically across two sets of latents, allowing a portion of the latent variability to be specified and the remaining variability sampled from a learned prior. 

149__ Physical implementation of quantum nonparametric learning with trapped  ions__arXiv:1906.03388
Author: Dan-Bo Zhang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03388
 Abstract: Nonparametric learning is able to make reliable predictions by extracting information from similarities between a new set of input data and all samples. Here we point out a quantum paradigm of nonparametric learning which offers an exponential speedup over the sample size. By encoding data into quantum feature space, similarity between the data is defined as an inner product of quantum states. A quantum training state is introduced to superpose all data of samples, encoding relevant information for learning its bipartite entanglement spectrum. We demonstrate that a trained state for prediction can be obtained by entanglement spectrum transformation, using quantum matrix toolbox. We further workout a feasible scheme to implement the quantum nonparametric learning with trapped ions, and demonstrate the power of quantum superposition for machine leaning with a state-of-the-art technology 

150__ A Novel Modeling Approach for All-Dielectric Metasurfaces Using Deep  Neural Networks__arXiv:1906.03387
Author: Sensong An
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03387
 Abstract: Metasurfaces have become a promising means for manipulating optical wavefronts in flat and high-performance optical devices. Conventional metasurface device design relies on trial-and-error methods to obtain target electromagnetic (EM) response, an approach that demands significant efforts to investigate the enormous number of possible meta-atom structures. In this paper, a deep neural network approach is introduced that significantly improves on both speed and accuracy compared to techniques currently used to assemble metasurface-based devices. Our neural network approach overcomes three key challenges that have limited previous neural-network-based design schemes: input/output vector dimensional mismatch, accurate EM-wave phase prediction, as well as adaptation to 3-D dielectric structures, and can be generically applied to a wide variety of metasurface device designs across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Using this new methodology, examples of neural networks capable of producing on-demand designs for meta-atoms, metasurface filters, and phase-change reconfigurable metasurfaces are demonstrated. 

151__ Lift Up and Act! Classifier Performance in Resource-Constrained  Applications__arXiv:1906.03374
Author: Galit Shmueli
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03374
 Abstract: Classification tasks are common across many fields and applications where the decision maker's action is limited by resource constraints. In direct marketing only a subset of customers is contacted; scarce human resources limit the number of interviews to the most promising job candidates; limited donated organs are prioritized to those with best fit. In such scenarios, performance measures such as the classification matrix, ROC analysis, and even ranking metrics such as AUC measures outcomes different from the action of interest. At the same time, gains and lift that do measure the relevant outcome are rarely used by machine learners. In this paper we define resource-constrained classifier performance as a task distinguished from classification and ranking. We explain how gains and lift can lead to different algorithm choices and discuss the effect of class distribution. 

152__ Structural Decompositions for End-to-End Relighting__arXiv:1906.03355
Author: Thomas Nestmeyer
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03355
 Abstract: Relighting is an essential step in artificially transferring an object from one image into another environment. For example, a believable teleconference in Augmented Reality requires a portrait recorded in the source environment to be displayed and relit consistent with the light configuration of the destination scene. In this paper, we investigate architectures for learning to both de-light and relight an image of a human face end-to-end. The architectures vary in how much they enforce physically-based image formation and rendering constraints. The most structured model decomposes the input image into intrinsic components according to a diffuse physics-based image formation model and augments the render to relight including non-diffuse effects. An intermediate model uses fewer intrinsic constraints and the least structured model makes no assumptions on the image formation. To train our models and evaluate the approach, we collected portraits of 21 subjects with various expressions and poses, each in a sequence of 32 individual light sources in a controlled light stage setup. Our method leads to precise and believable relighting results in challenging illumination conditions and poses, including when the subject is facing away from the camera. We compare our method to state-of-the-art relighting approaches and illustrate its superiority in a series of quantitative and qualitative experiments. 

153__ Detecting the Starting Frame of Actions in Video__arXiv:1906.03340
Author: Iljung S. Kwak
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03340
 Abstract: To understand causal relationships between events in the world, it is useful to pinpoint when actions occur in videos and to examine the state of the world at and around that time point. For example, one must accurately detect the start of an audience response -- laughter in a movie, cheering at a sporting event -- to understand the cause of the reaction. In this work, we focus on the problem of accurately detecting action starts rather than isolated events or action ends. We introduce a novel structured loss function based on matching predictions to true action starts that is tailored to this problem; it more heavily penalizes extra and missed action start detections over small misalignments. Recurrent neural networks are used to minimize a differentiable approximation of this loss. To evaluate these methods, we introduce the Mouse Reach Dataset, a large, annotated video dataset of mice performing a sequence of actions. The dataset was labeled by experts for the purpose of neuroscience research on causally relating neural activity to behavior. On this dataset, we demonstrate that the structured loss leads to significantly higher accuracy than a baseline of mean-squared error loss. 

154__ Benchmarking Minimax Linkage__arXiv:1906.03336
Author: Xiao Hui Tai
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03336
 Abstract: Minimax linkage was first introduced by Ao et al. [3] in 2004, as an alternative to standard linkage methods used in hierarchical clustering. Minimax linkage relies on distances to a prototype for each cluster; this prototype can be thought of as a representative object in the cluster, hence improving the interpretability of clustering results. Bien and Tibshirani analyzed properties of this method in 2011 [2], popularizing the method within the statistics community. Additionally, they performed comparisons of minimax linkage to standard linkage methods, making use of five data sets and two different evaluation metrics (distance to prototype and misclassification rate). In an effort to expand upon their work and evaluate minimax linkage more comprehensively, our benchmark study focuses on thorough method evaluation via multiple performance metrics on several well-described data sets. We also make all code and data publicly available through an R package, for full reproducibility. Similarly to [2], we find that minimax linkage often produces the smallest maximum minimax radius of all linkage methods, meaning that minimax linkage produces clusters where objects in a cluster are tightly clustered around their prototype. This is true across a range of values for the total number of clusters (k). However, this is not always the case, and special attention should be paid to the case when k is the true known value. For true k, minimax linkage does not always perform the best in terms of all the evaluation metrics studied, including maximum minimax radius. This paper was motivated by the IFCS Cluster Benchmarking Task Force's call for clustering benchmark studies and the white paper [5], which put forth guidelines and principles for comprehensive benchmarking in clustering. Our work is designed to be a neutral benchmark study of minimax linkage. 

155__ Bayesian Coresets from Scratch__arXiv:1906.03329
Author: Trevor Campbell
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03329
 Abstract: The proliferation of automated inference algorithms in Bayesian statistics has provided practitioners newfound access to fast, reproducible data analysis and powerful statistical models. Designing automated methods that are also both computationally scalable and theoretically sound, however, remains a significant challenge. Recent work on Bayesian coresets takes the approach of compressing the dataset before running a standard inference algorithm, providing both scalability and guarantees on posterior approximation error. But the automation of past coreset methods is limited because they depend on the availability of a reasonable coarse posterior approximation, which is difficult to specify in practice. In the present work we remove this requirement by formulating coreset construction as sparsity-constrained variational inference within an exponential family. This perspective leads to a novel construction via greedy optimization, and also provides a unifying information-geometric view of present and past methods. The proposed Riemannian coreset construction algorithm is fully automated, requiring no inputs aside from the dataset, probabilistic model, desired coreset size, and sample size used for Monte Carlo estimates. In addition to being easier to use than past methods, experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art Bayesian dataset summarization. 

156__ Efficient non-conjugate Gaussian process factor models for spike count  data using polynomial approximations__arXiv:1906.03318
Author: Stephen L. Keeley
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03318
 Abstract: Gaussian Process Factor Analysis (GPFA) has been broadly applied to the problem of identifying smooth, low-dimensional temporal structure underlying large-scale neural recordings. However, spike trains are non-Gaussian, which motivates combining GPFA with discrete observation models for binned spike count data. The drawback to this approach is that GPFA priors are not conjugate to count model likelihoods, which makes inference challenging. Here we address this obstacle by introducing a fast, approximate inference method for non-conjugate GPFA models. Our approach uses orthogonal second-order polynomials to approximate the nonlinear terms in the non-conjugate log-likelihood, resulting in a method we refer to as polynomial approximate log-likelihood (PAL) estimators. This approximation allows for accurate closed-form evaluation of marginal likelihood and fast numerical optimization for parameters and hyperparameters. We derive PAL estimators for GPFA models with binomial, Poisson, and negative binomial observations, and additionally show that the parameters obtained can be used to initialize black-box variational inference, which significantly speeds up and stabilizes the inference procedure for these factor analytic models. We apply these methods to data from mouse visual cortex and monkey higher-order visual and parietal cortices, and compare GPFA under three different spike count observation models to traditional GPFA. We demonstrate that PAL estimators achieve fast and accurate extraction of latent structure from multi-neuron spike train data. 

157__ Optimal Transport Relaxations with Application to Wasserstein GANs__arXiv:1906.03317
Author: Saied Mahdian
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03317
 Abstract: We propose a family of relaxations of the optimal transport problem which regularize the problem by introducing an additional minimization step over a small region around one of the underlying transporting measures. The type of regularization that we obtain is related to smoothing techniques studied in the optimization literature. When using our approach to estimate optimal transport costs based on empirical measures, we obtain statistical learning bounds which are useful to guide the amount of regularization, while maintaining good generalization properties. To illustrate the computational advantages of our regularization approach, we apply our method to training Wasserstein GANs. We obtain running time improvements, relative to current benchmarks, with no deterioration in testing performance (via FID). The running time improvement occurs because our new optimality-based threshold criterion reduces the number of expensive iterates of the generating networks, while increasing the number of actor-critic iterations. 

158__ Assessing incrementality in sequence-to-sequence models__arXiv:1906.03293
Author: Dennis Ulmer
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03293
 Abstract: Since their inception, encoder-decoder models have successfully been applied to a wide array of problems in computational linguistics. The most recent successes are predominantly due to the use of different variations of attention mechanisms, but their cognitive plausibility is questionable. In particular, because past representations can be revisited at any point in time, attention-centric methods seem to lack an incentive to build up incrementally more informative representations of incoming sentences. This way of processing stands in stark contrast with the way in which humans are believed to process language: continuously and rapidly integrating new information as it is encountered. In this work, we propose three novel metrics to assess the behavior of RNNs with and without an attention mechanism and identify key differences in the way the different model types process sentences. 

159__ a  New Disentanglement Dataset__arXiv:1906.03292
Author: Muhammad Waleed Gondal
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03292
 Abstract: Learning meaningful and compact representations with structurally disentangled semantic aspects is considered to be of key importance in representation learning. Since real-world data is notoriously costly to collect, many recent state-of-the-art disentanglement models have heavily relied on synthetic toy data-sets. In this paper, we propose a novel data-set which consists of over 450'000 images of physical 3D objects with seven factors of variation, such as object color, shape, size and position. In order to be able to control all the factors of variation precisely, we built an experimental platform where the objects are being moved by a robotic arm. In addition, we provide two more datasets which consist of simulations of the experimental setup. These datasets provide for the first time the possibility to systematically investigate how well different disentanglement methods perform on real data in comparison to simulation, and how simulated data can be leveraged to build better representations of the real world. 

160__ Adaptive Nonparametric Variational Autoencoder__arXiv:1906.03288
Author: Tingting Zhao
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03288
 Abstract: Clustering is used to find structure in unlabeled data by grouping similar objects together. Cluster analysis depends on the definition of similarity in the feature space. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Nonparametric Variational Autoencoder (AdapVAE) to perform end-to-end feature learning from raw data jointly with cluster membership learning through a Nonparametric Bayesian modeling framework with deep neural networks. It has the advantage of avoiding pre-definition of similarity or feature engineering. Our model relaxes the constraint of fixing the number of clusters in advance by assigning a Dirichlet Process prior on the latent representation in a low-dimensional feature space. It can adaptively detect novel clusters when new data arrives based on a learned model from historical data in an online unsupervised learning setting. We develop a joint online variational inference algorithm to learn feature representations and cluster assignments via iteratively optimizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO). Our experimental results demonstrate the capacity of our modelling framework to learn the number of clusters automatically using data, the flexibility to detect novel clusters with emerging data adaptively, the ability of high quality reconstruction and generation of samples without supervised information and the improvement over state-of-the-art end-to-end clustering methods in terms of accuracy on both image and text corpora benchmark datasets. 

161__ Effectiveness of Equalized Odds for Fair Classification under Imperfect  Group Information__arXiv:1906.03284
Author: Pranjal Awasthi
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03284
 Abstract: Most approaches for ensuring or improving a model's fairness with respect to a protected attribute (such as race or gender) assume access to the true value of the protected attribute for every data point. In many scenarios, however, perfect knowledge of the protected attribute is unrealistic. In this paper, we ask to what extent fairness interventions can be effective even with imperfect information about the protected attribute. In particular, we study this question in the context of the prominent equalized odds method of Hardt et al. (2016). We claim that as long as the perturbation of the protected attribute is somewhat moderate, one should still run equalized odds if one would run it knowing the true protected attribute: the bias of the classifier that we obtain using the perturbed attribute is smaller than the bias of the original classifier, and its error is not larger than the error of the equalized odds classifier obtained when working with the true protected attribute. 

162__ Reliable training and estimation of variance networks__arXiv:1906.03260
Author: Nicki S. Detlefsen
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03260
 Abstract: We propose and investigate new complementary methodologies for estimating predictive variance networks in regression neural networks. We derive a locally aware mini-batching scheme that result in sparse robust gradients, and show how to make unbiased weight updates to a variance network. Further, we formulate a heuristic for robustly fitting both the mean and variance networks post hoc. Finally, we take inspiration from posterior Gaussian processes and propose a network architecture with similar extrapolation properties to Gaussian processes. The proposed methodologies are complementary, and improve upon baseline methods individually. Experimentally, we investigate the impact on predictive uncertainty on multiple datasets and tasks ranging from regression, active learning and generative modeling. Experiments consistently show significant improvements in predictive uncertainty estimation over state-of-the-art methods across tasks and datasets. 

163__ A Brief  Survey__arXiv:1904.04973
Author: Yoshiharu Sato
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1904.04973
 Abstract: Financial portfolio management is one of the problems that are most frequently encountered in the investment industry. Nevertheless, it is not widely recognized that both Kelly Criterion and Risk Parity collapse into Mean Variance under some conditions, which implies that a universal solution to the portfolio optimization problem could potentially exist. In fact, the process of sequential computation of optimal component weights that maximize the portfolio's expected return subject to a certain risk budget can be reformulated as a discrete-time Markov Decision Process (MDP) and hence as a stochastic optimal control, where the system being controlled is a portfolio consisting of multiple investment components, and the control is its component weights. Consequently, the problem could be solved using model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) without knowing specific component dynamics. By examining existing methods of both value-based and policy-based model-free RL for the portfolio optimization problem, we identify some of the key unresolved questions and difficulties facing today's portfolio managers of applying model-free RL to their investment portfolios. 

164__ Solving a Class of Non-Convex Min-Max Games Using Iterative First Order  Methods__arXiv:1902.08297
Author: Maher Nouiehed
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1902.08297
 Abstract: Recent applications that arise in machine learning have surged significant interest in solving min-max saddle point games. This problem has been extensively studied in the convex-concave regime for which a global equilibrium solution can be computed efficiently. In this paper, we study the problem in the non-convex regime and show that an \varepsilon--first order stationary point of the game can be computed when one of the player's objective can be optimized to global optimality efficiently. In particular, we first consider the case where the objective of one of the players satisfies the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) condition. For such a game, we show that a simple multi-step gradient descent-ascent algorithm finds an \varepsilon--first order stationary point of the problem in \widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-2}) iterations. Then we show that our framework can also be applied to the case where the objective of the ``max-player'' is concave. In this case, we propose a multi-step gradient descent-ascent algorithm that finds an \varepsilon--first order stationary point of the game in \widetilde{\cal O}(\varepsilon^{-3.5}) iterations, which is the best known rate in the literature. We applied our algorithm to a fair classification problem of Fashion-MNIST dataset and observed that the proposed algorithm results in smoother training and better generalization. 

165__ Machine Learning Enabled Computational Screening of Inorganic Solid  Electrolytes for Dendrite Suppression with Li Metal Anode__arXiv:1804.04651
Author: Zeeshan Ahmad
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04651
 Abstract: Next generation batteries based on lithium (Li) metal anodes have been plagued by the dendritic electrodeposition of Li metal on the anode during cycling, resulting in short circuit and capacity loss. Suppression of dendritic growth through the use of solid electrolytes has emerged as one of the most promising strategies for enabling the use of Li metal anodes. We perform a computational screening of over 12,000 inorganic solids based on their ability to suppress dendrite initiation in contact with Li metal anode. Properties for mechanically isotropic and anisotropic interfaces that can be used in stability criteria for determining the propensity of dendrite initiation are usually obtained from computationally expensive first-principles methods. In order to obtain a large dataset for screening, we use machine learning models to predict the mechanical properties of several new solid electrolytes. We train a convolutional neural network on the shear and bulk moduli purely on structural features of the material. We use AdaBoost, Lasso and Bayesian ridge regression to train the elastic constants, where the choice of the model depended on the size of the training data and the noise that it can handle. Our models give us direct interpretability by revealing the dominant structural features affecting the elastic constants. The stiffness is found to increase with a decrease in volume per atom, increase in minimum anion-anion separation, and increase in sublattice (all but Li) packing fraction. Cross-validation/test performance suggests our models generalize well. We predict over 20 mechanically anisotropic interfaces between Li metal and 6 solid electrolytes which can be used to suppress dendrite growth. Our screened candidates are generally soft and highly anisotropic, and present opportunities for simultaneously obtaining dendrite suppression and high ionic conductivity in solid electrolytes.
