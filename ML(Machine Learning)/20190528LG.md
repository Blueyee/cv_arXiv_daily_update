001__ Understanding Generalization of Deep Neural Networks Trained with Noisy  Labels__arXiv:1905.11368
Author: Wei Hu
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11368
 Abstract: Over-parameterized deep neural networks trained by simple first-order methods are known to be able to fit any labeling of data. When the training dataset contains a fraction of noisy labels, can neural networks be resistant to over-fitting and still generalize on the true distribution? Inspired by recent theoretical work that established connections between over-parameterized neural networks and neural tangent kernel (NTK), we propose two simple regularization methods for this purpose: (i) regularization by the distance between the network parameters to initialization, and (ii) adding a trainable auxiliary variable to the network output for each training example. Theoretically, both methods are related to kernel ridge regression with respect to the NTK, and we prove their generalization guarantee on the true data distribution despite being trained using noisy labels. The generalization bound is independent of the network size, and only depends on the training inputs and true labels (instead of noisy labels) as well as the noise level in the labels. Empirical results verify the effectiveness of these methods on noisily labeled datasets. 

002__ Efficient candidate screening under multiple tests and implications for  fairness__arXiv:1905.11361
Author: Lee Cohen
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11361
 Abstract: When recruiting job candidates, employers rarely observe their underlying skill level directly. Instead, they must administer a series of interviews and/or collate other noisy signals in order to estimate the worker's skill. Traditional economics papers address screening models where employers access worker skill via a single noisy signal. In this paper, we extend this theoretical analysis to a multi-test setting, considering both Bernoulli and Gaussian models. We analyze the optimal employer policy both when the employer sets a fixed number of tests per candidate and when the employer can set a dynamic policy, assigning further tests adaptively based on results from the previous tests. To start, we characterize the optimal policy when employees constitute a single group, demonstrating some interesting trade-offs. Subsequently, we address the multi-group setting, demonstrating that when the noise levels vary across groups, a fundamental impossibility emerges whereby we cannot administer the same number of tests, subject candidates to the same decision rule, and yet realize the same outcomes in both groups. 

003__ Expression of Fractals Through Neural Network Functions__arXiv:1905.11345
Author: Nadav Dym
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11345
 Abstract: To help understand the underlying mechanisms of neural networks (NNs), several groups have, in recent years, studied the number of linear regions $\ell$ of piecewise linear functions generated by deep neural networks (DNN). In particular, they showed that $\ell$ can grow exponentially with the number of network parameters $p$, a property often used to explain the advantages of DNNs over shallow NNs in approximating complicated functions. Nonetheless, a simple dimension argument shows that DNNs cannot generate all piecewise linear functions with $\ell$ linear regions as soon as $\ell > p$. It is thus natural to seek to characterize specific families of functions with $\ell$ linear regions that can be constructed by DNNs. Iterated Function Systems (IFS) generate sequences of piecewise linear functions $F_k$ with a number of linear regions exponential in $k$. We show that, under mild assumptions, $F_k$ can be generated by a NN using only $\mathcal{O}(k)$ parameters. IFS are used extensively to generate, at low computational cost, natural-looking landscape textures in artificial images. They have also been proposed for compression of natural images, albeit with less commercial success. The surprisingly good performance of this fractal-based compression suggests that our visual system may lock in, to some extent, on self-similarities in images. The combination of this phenomenon with the capacity, demonstrated here, of DNNs to efficiently approximate IFS may contribute to the success of DNNs, particularly striking for image processing tasks, as well as suggest new algorithms for representing self similarities in images based on the DNN mechanism. 

004__ Parallel and Communication Avoiding Least Angle Regression__arXiv:1905.11340
Author: S. Das
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11340
 Abstract: We are interested in parallelizing the Least Angle Regression (LARS) algorithm for fitting linear regression models to high-dimensional data. We consider two parallel and communication avoiding versions of the basic LARS algorithm. The two algorithms apply to data that have different layout patterns (one is appropriate for row-partitioned data, and the other is appropriate for column-partitioned data), and they have different asymptotic costs and practical performance. The first is bLARS, a block version of LARS algorithm where we update b columns at each iteration. Assuming that the data are row-partitioned, bLARS reduces the number of arithmetic operations, latency, and bandwidth by a factor of b. The second is Tournament-bLARS (T-bLARS), a tournament version of LARS, in which case processors compete, by running several LARS computations in parallel, to choose b new columns to be added into the solution. Assuming that the data are column-partitioned, T-bLARS reduces latency by a factor of b. Similarly to LARS, our proposed methods generate a sequence of linear models. We present extensive numerical experiments that illustrate speed-ups up to 25x compared to LARS. 

005__ Fast Decomposable Submodular Function Minimization using Constrained  Total Variation__arXiv:1905.11327
Author: K S Sesh Kumar
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11327
 Abstract: We consider the problem of minimizing the sum of submodular set functions assuming minimization oracles of each summand function. Most existing approaches reformulate the problem as the convex minimization of the sum of the corresponding Lov\'asz extensions and the squared Euclidean norm, leading to algorithms requiring total variation oracles of the summand functions; without further assumptions, these more complex oracles require many calls to the simpler minimization oracles often available in practice. In this paper, we consider a modified convex problem requiring constrained version of the total variation oracles that can be solved with significantly fewer calls to the simple minimization oracles. We support our claims by showing results on graph cuts for 2D and 3D graphs 

006__ On approximating dropout noise injection__arXiv:1905.11320
Author: Natalie Schluter
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11320
 Abstract: This paper examines the assumptions of the derived equivalence between dropout noise injection and $L_2$ regularisation for logistic regression with negative log loss. We show that the approximation method is based on a divergent Taylor expansion, making, subsequent work using this approximation to compare the dropout trained logistic regression model with standard regularisers, remains unfortunately ill-founded to date. Moreover, the approximation approach is shown to be invalid using any robust constraints. We show how this finding extends to general neural network topologies that use a cross-entropy prediction layer. 

007__ An Efficient Reduction__arXiv:1905.11311
Author: Alon Gonen
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11311
 Abstract: We study the relationship between the notions of differentially private learning and online learning in games. Several recent works have shown that differentially private learning implies online learning, but an open problem of Neel, Roth, and Wu \cite{NeelAaronRoth2018} asks whether this implication is {\it efficient}. Specifically, does an efficient differentially private learner imply an efficient online learner? In this paper we resolve this open question in the context of pure differential privacy. We derive an efficient black-box reduction from differentially private learning to online learning from expert advice. 

008__ Stochastic Gradient Methods with Layer-wise Adaptive Moments for  Training of Deep Networks__arXiv:1905.11286
Author: Boris Ginsburg
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11286
 Abstract: We propose NovoGrad, a first-order stochastic gradient method with layer-wise gradient normalization via second moment estimators and with decoupled weight decay for a better regularization. The method requires half as much memory as Adam/AdamW. We evaluated NovoGrad on the diverse set of problems, including image classification, speech recognition, neural machine translation and language modeling. On these problems, NovoGrad performed equal to or better than SGD and Adam/AdamW. Empirically we show that NovoGrad (1) is very robust during the initial training phase and does not require learning rate warm-up, (2) works well with the same learning rate policy for different problems, and (3) generally performs better than other optimizers for very large batch sizes 

009__ Stochastic Multi-armed Bandits with Arm-specific Fairness Guarantees__arXiv:1905.11260
Author: Vishakha Patil
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11260
 Abstract: We study an interesting variant of the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem in which each arm is required to be pulled for at least a given fraction of the total available rounds. We investigate the interplay between learning and fairness in terms of a pre-specified vector specifying the fractions of guaranteed pulls. We define a Fairness-aware regret that takes into account the above fairness constraints and extends the conventional notion of regret in a natural way. We show that logarithmic regret can be achieved while (almost) satisfying the fairness requirements. In contrast to the current literature where the fairness notion is instance dependent, we consider that the fairness criterion is exogenously specified as an input to the algorithm. Our regret guarantee is universal i.e. holds for any given fairness vector. 

010__ Radar-based Feature Design and Multiclass Classification for Road User  Recognition__arXiv:1905.11256
Author: Nicolas Scheiner
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11256
 Abstract: The classification of individual traffic participants is a complex task, especially for challenging scenarios with multiple road users or under bad weather conditions. Radar sensors provide an - with respect to well established camera systems - orthogonal way of measuring such scenes. In order to gain accurate classification results, 50 different features are extracted from the measurement data and tested on their performance. From these features a suitable subset is chosen and passed to random forest and long short-term memory (LSTM) classifiers to obtain class predictions for the radar input. Moreover, it is shown why data imbalance is an inherent problem in automotive radar classification when the dataset is not sufficiently large. To overcome this issue, classifier binarization is used among other techniques in order to better account for underrepresented classes. A new method to couple the resulting probabilities is proposed and compared to others with great success. Final results show substantial improvements when compared to ordinary multiclass classification 

011__ Kernel Conditional Density Operators__arXiv:1905.11255
Author: Ingmar Schuster
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11255
 Abstract: We introduce a conditional density estimation model termed the conditional density operator. It naturally captures multivariate, multimodal output densities and is competitive with recent neural conditional density models and Gaussian processes. To derive the model, we propose a novel approach to the reconstruction of probability densities from their kernel mean embeddings by drawing connections to estimation of Radon-Nikodym derivatives in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). We prove finite sample error bounds which are independent of problem dimensionality. Furthermore, the resulting conditional density model is applied to real-world data and we demonstrate its versatility and competitive performance. 

012__ Learning by stochastic serializations__arXiv:1905.11245
Author: Pablo Strasser
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11245
 Abstract: Complex structures are typical in machine learning. Tailoring learning algorithms for every structure requires an effort that may be saved by defining a generic learning procedure adaptive to any complex structure. In this paper, we propose to map any complex structure onto a generic form, called serialization, over which we can apply any sequence-based density estimator. We then show how to transfer the learned density back onto the space of original structures. To expose the learning procedure to the structural particularities of the original structures, we take care that the serializations reflect accurately the structures' properties. Enumerating all serializations is infeasible. We propose an effective way to sample representative serializations from the complete set of serializations which preserves the statistics of the complete set. Our method is competitive or better than state of the art learning algorithms that have been specifically designed for given structures. In addition, since the serialization involves sampling from a combinatorial process it provides considerable protection from overfitting, which we clearly demonstrate on a number of experiments. 

013__ Emphasis Regularisation by Gradient Rescaling for Training Deep Neural  Networks with Noisy Labels__arXiv:1905.11233
Author: Xinshao Wang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11233
 Abstract: It is fundamental and challenging to train robust and accurate Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) when noisy labels exist. Although great progress has been made, there is still one crucial research question which is not thoroughly explored yet: What training examples should be focused and how much more should they be emphasised when training DNNs under label noise? In this work, we study this question and propose gradient rescaling (GR) to solve it. GR modifies the magnitude of logit vector's gradient to emphasise on relatively easier training data points when severe noise exists, which functions as explicit emphasis regularisation to improve the generalisation performance of DNNs. Apart from regularisation, we also interpret GR from the perspectives of sample reweighting and designing robust loss functions. Therefore, our proposed GR helps connect these three approaches in the literature. We empirically demonstrate that GR is highly noise-robust and outperforms the state-of-the-art noise-tolerant algorithms by a large margin, e.g., increasing 7% on CIFAR-100 with 40% noisy labels. It is also significantly superior to standard regularisors. Furthermore, we present comprehensive ablation studies to explore the behaviours of GR under different cases, which is informative for applying GR in real-world scenarios. 

014__ Induction of Non-Monotonic Rules From Statistical Learning Models Using  High-Utility Itemset Mining__arXiv:1905.11226
Author: Farhad Shakerin
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11226
 Abstract: We present a fast and scalable algorithm to induce non-monotonic logic programs from statistical learning models. We reduce the problem of search for best clauses to instances of the High-Utility Itemset Mining (HUIM) problem. In the HUIM problem, feature values and their importance are treated as transactions and utilities respectively. We make use of TreeExplainer, a fast and scalable implementation of the Explainable AI tool SHAP, to extract locally important features and their weights from ensemble tree models. Our experiments with UCI standard benchmarks suggest a significant improvement in terms of classification evaluation metrics and running time of the training algorithm compared to ALEPH, a state-of-the-art Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) system. 

015__ Provable robustness against all adversarial $l_p$-perturbations for  $p\geq 1$__arXiv:1905.11213
Author: Francesco Croce
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11213
 Abstract: In recent years several adversarial attacks and defenses have been proposed. Often seemingly robust models turn out to be non-robust when more sophisticated attacks are used. One way out of this dilemma are provable robustness guarantees. While provably robust models for specific $l_p$-perturbation models have been developed, they are still vulnerable to other $l_q$-perturbations. We propose a new regularization scheme, MMR-Universal, for ReLU networks which enforces robustness wrt $l_1$- and $l_\infty$-perturbations and show how that leads to provably robust models wrt any $l_p$-norm for $p\geq 1$. 

016__ Model-Agnostic Counterfactual Explanations for Consequential Decisions__arXiv:1905.11190
Author: Amir-Hossein Karimi
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11190
 Abstract: Predictive models are being increasingly used to support consequential decision making at the individual level in contexts such as pretrial bail and loan approval. As a result, there is increasing social and legal pressure to provide explanations that help the affected individuals not only to understand why a prediction was output, but also how to act to obtain a desired outcome. To this end, several works have proposed methods to generate counterfactual explanations. However, they are often restricted to a particular subset of models (e.g., decision trees or linear models), and cannot directly handle the mixed (numerical and nominal) nature of the features describing each individual. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic algorithm to generate counterfactual explanations that builds on the standard theory and tools from formal verification. Specifically, our algorithm solves a sequence of satisfiability problems, where a wide variety of predictive models and distances in mixed feature spaces, as well as natural notions of plausibility and diversity, are represented as logic formulas. Our experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our approach can flexibly handle widely deployed predictive models, while providing meaningfully closer counterfactuals than existing approaches. 

017__ Radial Prediction Layer__arXiv:1905.11150
Author: Christian Herta
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11150
 Abstract: For a broad variety of critical applications, it is essential to know how confident a classification prediction is. In this paper, we discuss the drawbacks of softmax to calculate class probabilities and to handle uncertainty in Bayesian neural networks. We introduce a new kind of prediction layer called radial prediction layer (RPL) to overcome these issues. In contrast to the softmax classification, RPL is based on the open-world assumption. Therefore, the class prediction probabilities are much more meaningful to assess the uncertainty concerning the novelty of the input. We show that neural networks with RPLs can be learned in the same way as neural networks using softmax. On a 2D toy data set (spiral data), we demonstrate the fundamental principles and advantages. On the real-world ImageNet data set, we show that the open-world properties are beneficially fulfilled. Additionally, we show that RPLs are less sensible to adversarial attacks on the MNIST data set. Due to its features, we expect RPL to be beneficial in a broad variety of applications, especially in critical environments, such as medicine or autonomous driving. 

018__ Generating Speech/Face Animation from Single Audio with  Attention-Based Bidirectional LSTM Networks__arXiv:1905.11142
Author: Guanzhong Tian
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11142
 Abstract: We propose an end to end deep learning approach for generating real-time facial animation from just audio. Specifically, our deep architecture employs deep bidirectional long short-term memory network and attention mechanism to discover the latent representations of time-varying contextual information within the speech and recognize the significance of different information contributed to certain face status. Therefore, our model is able to drive different levels of facial movements at inference and automatically keep up with the corresponding pitch and latent speaking style in the input audio, with no assumption or further human intervention. Evaluation results show that our method could not only generate accurate lip movements from audio, but also successfully regress the speaker's time-varying facial movements. 

019__ Provably Powerful Graph Networks__arXiv:1905.11136
Author: Haggai Maron
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11136
 Abstract: Recently, the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) graph isomorphism test was used to measure the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNN). It was shown that the popular message passing GNN cannot distinguish between graphs that are indistinguishable by the 1-WL test (Morris et al. 2018; Xu et al. 2019). Unfortunately, many simple instances of graphs are indistinguishable by the 1-WL test. In search for more expressive graph learning models we build upon the recent k-order invariant and equivariant graph neural networks (Maron et al. 2019a,b) and present two results: First, we show that such k-order networks can distinguish between non-isomorphic graphs as good as the k-WL tests, which are provably stronger than the 1-WL test for k>2. This makes these models strictly stronger than message passing models. Unfortunately, the higher expressiveness of these models comes with a computational cost of processing high order tensors. Second, setting our goal at building a provably stronger, simple and scalable model we show that a reduced 2-order network containing just scaled identity operator, augmented with a single quadratic operation (matrix multiplication) has a provable 3-WL expressive power. Differently put, we suggest a simple model that interleaves applications of standard Multilayer-Perceptron (MLP) applied to the feature dimension and matrix multiplication. We validate this model by presenting state of the art results on popular graph classification and regression tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first practical invariant/equivariant model with guaranteed 3-WL expressiveness, strictly stronger than message passing models. 

020__ Learning Multiple Markov Chains via Adaptive Allocation__arXiv:1905.11128
Author: M. Sadegh Talebi
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11128
 Abstract: We study the problem of learning the transition matrices of a set of Markov chains from a single stream of observations on each chain. We assume that the Markov chains are ergodic but otherwise unknown. The learner can sample Markov chains sequentially to observe their states. The goal of the learner is to sequentially select various chains to learn transition matrices uniformly well with respect to some loss function. We introduce a notion of loss that naturally extends the squared loss for learning distributions to the case of Markov chains, and further characterize the notion of being \emph{uniformly good} in all problem instances. We present a novel learning algorithm that efficiently balances \emph{exploration} and \emph{exploitation} intrinsic to this problem, without any prior knowledge of the chains. We provide finite-sample PAC-type guarantees on the performance of the algorithm. Further, we show that our algorithm asymptotically attains an optimal loss. 

021__ Imitation Learning via Regularized Behavioral Cloning__arXiv:1905.11108
Author: Siddharth Reddy
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11108
 Abstract: Learning to imitate expert behavior given action demonstrations containing high-dimensional, continuous observations and unknown dynamics is a difficult problem in robotic control. Simple approaches based on behavioral cloning (BC) suffer from state distribution shift, while more complex methods that generalize to out-of-distribution states can be difficult to use, since they typically involve adversarial optimization. We propose an alternative that combines the simplicity of BC with the robustness of adversarial imitation learning. The key insight is that under the maximum entropy model of expert behavior, BC corresponds to fitting a soft Q function that maximizes the likelihood of observed actions. This perspective suggests a way to regularize BC so that it generalizes to out-of-distribution states: combine the standard maximum-likelihood objective with a penalty on the soft Bellman error of the soft Q function. We show that this penalty term gives the agent an incentive to take actions that lead it back to demonstrated states when it encounters new states. Experiments show that our method outperforms BC and GAIL on a variety of image-based and low-dimensional environments in Box2D, Atari, and MuJoCo. 

022__ Value Function Decomposition with  Future Prediction__arXiv:1905.11100
Author: Hongyao Tang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11100
 Abstract: Value functions are crucial for model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) to obtain a policy implicitly or guide the policy updates. Value estimation heavily depends on the stochasticity of environmental dynamics and the quality of reward signals. In this paper, we propose a two-step understanding of value estimation from the perspective of future prediction, through decomposing the value function into a reward-independent future dynamics part and a policy-independent trajectory return part. We then derive a practical deep RL algorithm from the above decomposition, consisting of a convolutional trajectory representation model, a conditional variational dynamics model to predict the expected representation of future trajectory and a convex trajectory return model that maps a trajectory representation to its return. Our algorithm is evaluated in MuJoCo continuous control tasks and shows superior results under both common settings and delayed reward settings. 

023__ A Rate-Distortion Framework for Explaining Neural Network Decisions__arXiv:1905.11092
Author: Jan Macdonald
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11092
 Abstract: We formalise the widespread idea of interpreting neural network decisions as an explicit optimisation problem in a rate-distortion framework. A set of input features is deemed relevant for a classification decision if the expected classifier score remains nearly constant when randomising the remaining features. We discuss the computational complexity of finding small sets of relevant features and show that the problem is complete for $\mathsf{NP}^\mathsf{PP}$, an important class of computational problems frequently arising in AI tasks. Furthermore, we show that it even remains $\mathsf{NP}$-hard to only approximate the optimal solution to within any non-trivial approximation factor. Finally, we consider a continuous problem relaxation and develop a heuristic solution strategy based on assumed density filtering for deep ReLU neural networks. We present numerical experiments for two image classification data sets where we outperform established methods in particular for sparse explanations of neural network decisions. 

024__ Plug-in Factorization for Latent Representation Disentanglement__arXiv:1905.11088
Author: Jee Seok Yoon
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11088
 Abstract: In this work, we propose a Factorized Disentangler-Entangler Network (FDEN) that learns to decompose a latent representation into two mutually independent factors, namely, identity and style. Given a latent representation, the proposed framework draws a set of interpretable factors aligned to identity of an observed data and learns to maximize the independency between these factors. Our work introduces an idea for a plug-in method to disentangle latent representations of already learned deep models with no affect to the model. In doing so, it brings the possibilities of extending state-of-the-art models to solve different tasks and also maintain the performance of its original task. Thus, FDEN is naturally applicable to jointly perform multiple tasks such as few-shot learning and image-to-image translation in a single framework. We show the effectiveness of our work in disentangling a latent representation in two parts. First, to evaluate the alignment of factor to an identity, we perform few-shot learning using only the aligned factor. Then, to evaluate the effectiveness of decomposition of latent representation and to show that plugin method does not affect the deep model in its performance, we perform image-to-image style transfer by mixing factors of different images. These evaluations show, qualitatively and quantitatively, that our proposed framework can indeed disentangle a latent representation. 

025__ Solving 1D Scalar Conservation Laws via Deep  Reinforcement Learning__arXiv:1905.11079
Author: Yufei Wang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11079
 Abstract: Conservation laws are considered to be fundamental laws of nature. It has broad application in many fields including physics, chemistry, biology, geology, and engineering. Solving the differential equations associated with conservation laws is a major branch in computational mathematics. Recent success of machine learning, especially deep learning, in areas such as computer vision and natural language processing, has attracted a lot of attention from the community of computational mathematics and inspired many intriguing works in combining machine learning with traditional methods. In this paper, we are the first to explore the possibility and benefit of solving nonlinear conservation laws using deep reinforcement learning. As a proof of concept, we focus on 1-dimensional scalar conservation laws. We deploy the machinery of deep reinforcement learning to train a policy network that can decide on how the numerical solutions should be approximated in a sequential and spatial-temporal adaptive manner. We will show that the problem of solving conservation laws can be naturally viewed as a sequential decision making process and the numerical schemes learned in such a way can easily enforce long-term accuracy. Furthermore, the learned policy network can determine a good local discrete approximation based on the current state of the solution, which essentially makes the proposed method a meta-learning approach. In other words, the proposed method is capable of learning how to discretize for a given situation mimicking human experts. Finally, we will provide details on how the policy network is trained, how well it performs compared with some state-of-the-art numerical solvers such as WENO schemes, and how well it generalizes. 

026__ Learning Dataset Meta-Features__arXiv:1905.11063
Author: Hadi S. Jomaa
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11063
 Abstract: Machine learning tasks such as optimizing the hyper-parameters of a model for a new dataset or few-shot learning can be vastly accelerated if they are not done from scratch for every new dataset, but carry over findings from previous runs. Meta-learning makes use of features of a whole dataset such as its number of instances, its number of predictors, the means of the predictors etc., so called meta-features, dataset summary statistics or simply dataset characteristics, which so far have been hand-crafted, often specifically for the task at hand. More recently, unsupervised dataset encoding models based on variational auto-encoders have been successful in learning such characteristics for the special case when all datasets follow the same schema, but not beyond. In this paper we design a novel model, Dataset2Vec, that is able to characterize datasets with a latent feature vector based on batches and thus is able to generalize beyond datasets having the same schema to arbitrary (tabular) datasets. To do so, we employ auxiliary learning tasks on batches of datasets, esp. to distinguish batches from different datasets. We show empirically that the meta-features collected from batches of similar datasets are concentrated within a small area in the latent space, hence preserving similarity. We also show that using the dataset characteristics learned by Dataset2Vec in a state-of-the-art hyper-parameter optimization model outperforms the hand-crafted meta-features that have been used in the hyper-parameter optimization literature so far. As a result, we advance the current state-of-the-art results for hyper-parameter optimization. 

027__ Quantization-Based Regularization for Autoencoders__arXiv:1905.11062
Author: Hanwei Wu
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11062
 Abstract: Autoencoders and their variations provide unsupervised models for learning low-dimensional representations for downstream tasks. Without proper regularization, autoencoder models are susceptible to the overfitting problem and the so-called posterior collapse phenomenon. In this paper, we introduce a quantization-based regularizer in the bottleneck stage of autoencoder models to learn meaningful latent representations. We combine both perspectives of Vector Quantized-Variational AutoEncoders (VQ-VAE) and classical denoising regularization schemes of neural networks. We interpret quantizers as regularizers that constrain latent representations while fostering a similarity mapping at the encoder. Before quantization, we impose noise on the latent variables and use a Bayesian estimator to optimize the quantizer-based representation. The introduced bottleneck Bayesian estimator outputs the posterior mean of the centroids to the decoder, and thus, is performing soft quantization of the latent variables. We show that our proposed regularization method results in improved latent representations for both supervised learning and clustering downstream tasks when compared to autoencoders using other bottleneck structures. 

028__ Learning to Auto Weight__arXiv:1905.11058
Author: Zhenmao Li
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11058
 Abstract: Example weighting algorithm is an effective solution to the training bias problem. However, typical methods are usually limited to human knowledge and require laborious tuning of hyperparameters. In this study, we propose a novel example weighting framework called Learning to Auto Weight (LAW), which can learn weighting policy from data adaptively based on reinforcement learning (RL). To shrink the huge searching space in a complete training process, we divide the training procedure consisting of numerous iterations into a small number of stages, and then search a low-deformational continuous vector as action, which determines the weight of each sample. To make training more efficient, we make an innovative design of the reward to remove randomness during the RL process. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of weighting policy explored by LAW over standard training pipeline. Especially, compared with baselines, LAW can find a better weighting schedule which achieves higher accuracy in the origin CIFAR dataset, and over 10% higher in accuracy on the contaminated CIFAR dataset with 30% label noises. Our code will be released soon. 

029__ Thresholding Bandit with Optimal Aggregate Regret__arXiv:1905.11046
Author: Chao Tao
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11046
 Abstract: We consider the thresholding bandit problem, whose goal is to find arms of mean rewards above a given threshold $\theta$, with a fixed budget of $T$ trials. We introduce LSA, a new, simple and anytime algorithm that aims to minimize the aggregate regret (or the expected number of mis-classified arms). We prove that our algorithm is instance-wise asymptotically optimal. We also provide comprehensive empirical results to demonstrate the algorithm's superior performance over existing algorithms under a variety of different scenarios. 

030__ Policy Search by Target Distribution Learning for Continuous Control__arXiv:1905.11041
Author: Chuheng Zhang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11041
 Abstract: We observe that several existing policy gradient methods (such as vanilla policy gradient, PPO, A2C) may suffer from overly large gradients when the current policy is close to deterministic (even in some very simple environments), leading to an unstable training process. To address this issue, we propose a new method, called \emph{target distribution learning} (TDL), for policy improvement in reinforcement learning. TDL alternates between proposing a target distribution and training the policy network to approach the target distribution. TDL is more effective in constraining the KL divergence between updated policies, and hence leads to more stable policy improvements over iterations. Our experiments show that TDL algorithms perform comparably to (or better than) state-of-the-art algorithms for most continuous control tasks in the MuJoCo environment while being more stable in training. 

031__ Lightlike Neuromanifolds, Occam's Razor and Deep Learning__arXiv:1905.11027
Author: Ke Sun
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11027
 Abstract: Why do deep neural networks generalize with a very high dimensional parameter space? We took an information theoretic approach. We find that the dimensionality of the parameter space can be studied by singular semi-Riemannian geometry and is upper-bounded by the sample size. We adapt Fisher information to this singular neuromanifold. We use random matrix theory to derive a minimum description length of a deep learning model, where the spectrum of the Fisher information matrix plays a key role to improve generalisation. 

032__ Training Deep Neural  Networks for URLLC__arXiv:1905.11017
Author: Chengjian Sun
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11017
 Abstract: Learning the optimized solution as a function of environmental parameters is effective in solving numerical optimization in real time for time-sensitive applications. Existing works of learning to optimize train deep neural networks (DNN) with labels, and the learnt solution are inaccurate, which cannot be employed to ensure the stringent quality of service. In this paper, we propose a framework to learn the latent function with unsupervised deep learning, where the property that the optimal solution should satisfy is used as the "supervision signal" implicitly. The framework is applicable to both functional and variable optimization problems with constraints. We take a variable optimization problem in ultra-reliable and low-latency communications as an example, which demonstrates that the ultra-high reliability can be supported by the DNN without supervision labels. 

033__ Modelling Early User-Game Interactions for Joint Estimation of Survival  Time and Churn Probability__arXiv:1905.10998
Author: Valerio Bonometti
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10998
 Abstract: Data-driven approaches which aim to identify and predict player engagement are becoming increasingly popular in games industry contexts. This is due to the growing practice of tracking and storing large volumes of in-game telemetries coupled with a desire to tailor the gaming experience to the end-user's needs. These approaches are particularly useful not just for companies adopting Game-as-a-Service (GaaS) models (e.g. for re-engagement strategies) but also for those working under persistent content-delivery regimes (e.g. for better audience targeting). A major challenge for the latter is to build engagement models of the user which are data-efficient, holistic and can generalize across multiple game titles and genres with minimal adjustments. This work leverages a theoretical framework rooted in engagement and behavioural science research for building a model able to estimate engagement-related behaviours employing only a minimal set of game-agnostic metrics. Through a series of experiments we show how, by modelling early user-game interactions, this approach can make joint estimates of long-term survival time and churn probability across several single-player games in a range of genres. The model proposed is very suitable for industry applications since it relies on a minimal set of metrics and observations, scales well with the number of users and is explicitly designed to work across a diverse range of titles. 

034__ Graph Filtration Learning__arXiv:1905.10996
Author: Christoph Hofer
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10996
 Abstract: We propose an approach to learning with graph-structured data in the problem domain of graph classification. In particular, we present a novel type of readout operation to aggregate node features into a graph-level representation. To this end, we leverage persistent homology computed via a real-valued, learnable, filter function. We establish the theoretical foundation for differentiating through the persistent homology computation. Empirically, we show that this type of readout operation compares favorably to previous techniques, especially when the graph connectivity structure is informative for the learning problem. 

035__ Edge Contraction Pooling for Graph Neural Networks__arXiv:1905.10990
Author: Frederik Diehl
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10990
 Abstract: Graph Neural Network (GNN) research has concentrated on improving convolutional layers, with little attention paid to developing graph pooling layers. Yet pooling layers can enable GNNs to reason over abstracted groups of nodes instead of single nodes. To close this gap, we propose a graph pooling layer relying on the notion of edge contraction: EdgePool learns a localized and sparse hard pooling transform. We show that EdgePool outperforms alternative pooling methods, can be easily integrated into most GNN models, and improves performance on both node and graph classification. 

036__ Natural Compression for Distributed Deep Learning__arXiv:1905.10988
Author: Samuel Horvath
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10988
 Abstract: Due to their hunger for big data, modern deep learning models are trained in parallel, often in distributed environments, where communication of model updates is the bottleneck. Various update compression (e.g., quantization, sparsification, dithering) techniques have been proposed in recent years as a successful tool to alleviate this problem. In this work, we introduce a new, remarkably simple and theoretically and practically effective compression technique, which we call natural compression (NC). Our technique is applied individually to all entries of the to-be-compressed update vector and works by randomized rounding to the nearest (negative or positive) power of two. NC is "natural" since the nearest power of two of a real expressed as a float can be obtained without any computation, simply by ignoring the mantissa. We show that compared to no compression, NC increases the second moment of the compressed vector by the tiny factor 9/8 only, which means that the effect of NC on the convergence speed of popular training algorithms, such as distributed SGD, is negligible. However, the communications savings enabled by NC are substantial, leading to 3-4x improvement in overall theoretical running time. For applications requiring more aggressive compression, we generalize NC to natural dithering, which we prove is exponentially better than the immensely popular random dithering technique. Our compression operators can be used on their own or in combination with existing operators for a more aggressive combined effect. Finally, we show that N is particularly effective for the in-network aggregation (INA) framework for distributed training, where the update aggregation is done on a switch, which can only perform integer computations. 

037__ Learning to Route in Similarity Graphs__arXiv:1905.10987
Author: Dmitry Baranchuk
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10987
 Abstract: Recently similarity graphs became the leading paradigm for efficient nearest neighbor search, outperforming traditional tree-based and LSH-based methods. Similarity graphs perform the search via greedy routing: a query traverses the graph and in each vertex moves to the adjacent vertex that is the closest to this query. In practice, similarity graphs are often susceptible to local minima, when queries do not reach its nearest neighbors, getting stuck in suboptimal vertices. In this paper we propose to learn the routing function that overcomes local minima via incorporating information about the graph global structure. In particular, we augment the vertices of a given graph with additional representations that are learned to provide the optimal routing from the start vertex to the query nearest neighbor. By thorough experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed learnable routing successfully diminishes the local minima problem and significantly improves the overall search performance. 

038__ Attention-based Supply-Demand Prediction for Autonomous Vehicles__arXiv:1905.10983
Author: Zikai Zhang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10983
 Abstract: As one of the important functions of the intelligent transportation system (ITS), supply-demand prediction for autonomous vehicles provides a decision basis for its control. In this paper, we present two prediction models (i.e. ARLP model and Advanced ARLP model) based on two system environments that only the current day's historical data is available or several days' historical data are available. These two models jointly consider the spatial, temporal, and semantic relations. Spatial dependency is captured with residual network and dimension reduction. Short term temporal dependency is captured with LSTM. Long term temporal dependency and temporal shifting are captured with LSTM and attention mechanism. Semantic dependency is captured with multi-attention mechanism and autocorrelation coefficient method. Extensive experiments show that our frameworks provide more accurate and stable prediction results than the existing methods. 

039__ Scalable K-Medoids via True Error Bound and Familywise Bandits__arXiv:1905.10979
Author: Aravindakshan Babu
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10979
 Abstract: K-Medoids(KM) is a standard clustering method, used extensively on semi-metric data. Error analyses of KM have traditionally used an in-sample notion of error, which can be far from the true error and suffer from generalization error. We formalize the true K-Medoid error based on the underlying data distribution, by decomposing it into fundamental statistical problems of: minimum estimation (ME) and minimum mean estimation (MME). We provide a convergence result for MME and bound the true KM error for iid data. Inspired by this bound, we propose a computationally efficient, distributed KM algorithm namely MCPAM. MCPAM has expected runtime $\mathcal{O}(km)$ and provides massive computational savings for a small tradeoff in accuracy. We verify the quality and scaling properties of MCPAM on various datasets. And achieve the hitherto unachieved feat of calculating the KM of 1 billion points on semi-metric spaces. 

040__ An Empirical Study on Post-processing Methods for Word Embeddings__arXiv:1905.10971
Author: Shuai Tang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10971
 Abstract: Word embeddings learnt from large corpora have been adopted in various applications in natural language processing and served as the general input representations to learning systems. Recently, a series of post-processing methods have been proposed to boost the performance of word embeddings on similarity comparison and analogy retrieval tasks, and some have been adapted to compose sentence representations. The general hypothesis behind these methods is that by enforcing the embedding space to be more isotropic, the similarity between words can be better expressed. We view these methods as an approach to shrink the covariance/gram matrix, which is estimated by learning word vectors, towards a scaled identity matrix. By optimising an objective in the semi-Riemannian manifold with Centralised Kernel Alignment (CKA), we are able to search for the optimal shrinkage parameter, and provide a post-processing method to smooth the spectrum of learnt word vectors which yields improved performance on downstream tasks. 

041__ Interpretable deep Gaussian processes__arXiv:1905.10963
Author: Chi-Ken Lu
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10963
 Abstract: We propose interpretable deep Gaussian Processes (GPs) that combine the expressiveness of deep Neural Networks (NNs) with quantified uncertainty of deep GPs. Our approach is based on approximating deep GP as a GP, which allows explicit, analytic forms for compositions of a wide variety of kernels. Consequently, our approach admits interpretation as both NNs with specified activation functions and as a variational approximation to deep GPs. We provide general recipes for deriving the effective kernels for deep GPs of two, three, or infinitely many layers, composed of homogeneous or heterogeneous kernels. Results illustrate the expressiveness of our effective kernels through samples from the prior and inference on simulated data and demonstrate advantages of interpretability by analysis of analytic forms, drawing relations and equivalences across kernels, and a priori identification of non-pathological regimes of hyperparameter space. 

042__ Explainable Reinforcement Learning Through a Causal Lens__arXiv:1905.10958
Author: Prashan Madumal
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10958
 Abstract: Prevalent theories in cognitive science propose that humans understand and represent the knowledge of the world through causal relationships. In making sense of the world, we build causal models in our mind to encode cause-effect relations of events and use these to explain why new events happen. In this paper, we use causal models to derive causal explanations of behaviour of reinforcement learning agents. We present an approach that learns a structural causal model during reinforcement learning and encodes causal relationships between variables of interest. This model is then used to generate explanations of behaviour based on counterfactual analysis of the causal model. We report on a study with 120 participants who observe agents playing a real-time strategy game (Starcraft II) and then receive explanations of the agents' behaviour. We investigated: 1) participants' understanding gained by explanations through task prediction; 2) explanation satisfaction and 3) trust. Our results show that causal model explanations perform better on these measures compared to two other baseline explanation models. 

043__ Transcribing Content from Structural Images with Spotlight Mechanism__arXiv:1905.10954
Author: Yu Yin
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10954
 Abstract: Transcribing content from structural images, e.g., writing notes from music scores, is a challenging task as not only the content objects should be recognized, but the internal structure should also be preserved. Existing image recognition methods mainly work on images with simple content (e.g., text lines with characters), but are not capable to identify ones with more complex content (e.g., structured symbols), which often follow a fine-grained grammar. To this end, in this paper, we propose a hierarchical Spotlight Transcribing Network (STN) framework followed by a two-stage "where-to-what" solution. Specifically, we first decide "where-to-look" through a novel spotlight mechanism to focus on different areas of the original image following its structure. Then, we decide "what-to-write" by developing a GRU based network with the spotlight areas for transcribing the content accordingly. Moreover, we propose two implementations on the basis of STN, i.e., STNM and STNR, where the spotlight movement follows the Markov property and Recurrent modeling, respectively. We also design a reinforcement method to refine the framework by self-improving the spotlight mechanism. We conduct extensive experiments on many structural image datasets, where the results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of STN framework. 

044__ First- and High-Order Bipartite Embeddings__arXiv:1905.10953
Author: Justin Sybrandt
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10953
 Abstract: Typical graph embeddings may not capture type-specific bipartite graph features that arise in such areas as recommender systems, data visualization, and drug discovery. Machine learning methods utilized in these applications would be better served with specialized embedding techniques. We propose two embeddings for bipartite graphs that decompose edges into sets of indirect relationships between node neighborhoods. When sampling higher-order relationships, we reinforce similarities through algebraic distance on graphs. We also introduce ensemble embeddings to combine both into a "best of both worlds" embedding. The proposed methods are evaluated on link prediction and recommendation tasks and compared with other state-of-the-art embeddings. While being all highly beneficial in applications, we demonstrate that none of the considered embeddings is clearly superior (in contrast to what is claimed in many papers), and discuss the trade offs present among them. Reproducibility: Our code, data sets, and results are all publicly available online at: this http URL 

045__ A Unified Representation for Heterogeneous Test Questions__arXiv:1905.10949
Author: Yu Yin
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10949
 Abstract: Understanding learning materials (e.g. test questions) is a crucial issue in online learning systems, which can promote many applications in education domain. Unfortunately, many supervised approaches suffer from the problem of scarce human labeled data, whereas abundant unlabeled resources are highly underutilized. To alleviate this problem, an effective solution is to use pre-trained representations for question understanding. However, existing pre-training methods in NLP area are infeasible to learn test question representations due to several domain-specific characteristics in education. First, questions usually comprise of heterogeneous data including content text, images and side information. Second, there exists both basic linguistic information as well as domain logic and knowledge. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel pre-training method, namely QuesNet, for comprehensively learning question representations. Specifically, we first design a unified framework to aggregate question information with its heterogeneous inputs into a comprehensive vector. Then we propose a two-level hierarchical pre-training algorithm to learn better understanding of test questions in an unsupervised way. Here, a novel holed language model objective is developed to extract low-level linguistic features, and a domain-oriented objective is proposed to learn high-level logic and knowledge. Moreover, we show that QuesNet has good capability of being fine-tuned in many question-based tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale real-world question data, where the experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of QuesNet for question understanding as well as its superior applicability. 

046__ Provably Efficient Imitation Learning from Observation Alone__arXiv:1905.10948
Author: Wen Sun
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10948
 Abstract: We study Imitation Learning (IL) from Observations alone (ILFO) in large-scale MDPs. While most IL algorithms rely on an expert to directly provide actions to the learner, in this setting the expert only supplies sequences of observations. We design a new model-free algorithm for ILFO, Forward Adversarial Imitation Learning (FAIL) ,which learns a sequence of time-dependent policies by minimizing an Integral Probability Metric between the observation distributions of the expert policy and the learner. FAIL is the first provably efficient algorithm inILFO setting, which learns a near-optimal policy with a number of samples that is polynomial in all relevant parameters but independent of the number of unique observations. The resulting theory extends the domain of provably sample efficient learning algorithms beyond existing results, which typically only consider tabular reinforcement learning settings or settings that require access to a near-optimal reset distribution. We also demonstrate the efficacy ofFAIL on multiple OpenAI Gym control tasks. 

047__ On Asymptotic Behaviors of Graph CNNs from Dynamical Systems Perspective__arXiv:1905.10947
Author: Kenta Oono
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10947
 Abstract: Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (graph CNNs) are a promising deep learning approach for analyzing graph-structured data. However, it is known that they do not improve (or sometimes worsen) their predictive performance as we pile up more layers and make them deeper. To tackle this problem, we investigate the expressive power of graph CNNs by analyzing their asymptotic behaviors as the layer size tends to infinity. Our strategy is to generalize the forward propagation of a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), which is one of the most popular graph CNN variants, as a specific dynamical system. In the case of GCNs, we show that when the weights satisfy the conditions determined by the spectra of the (augmented) normalized Laplacian, the output of GCNs exponentially approaches the set of signals that carry only information of the connected components and node degrees for distinguishing nodes. Our theory enables us to directly relate the expressive power of GCNs with the topological information of the underlying graphs, which is inherent in the graph spectra. To demonstrate this, we characterize the asymptotic behavior of GCNs on the Erd\H{o}s -- R\'{e}nyi graph. We show that when the Erd\H{o}s -- R\'{e}nyi graph is sufficiently dense and large, a wide range of GCNs on them suffers from this ``information loss" in the limit of infinite layers with high probability. Furthermore, our theory provides principled guidelines for the weight normalization of graph CNNs. We experimentally confirmed that weight scaling based on our theory enhanced the predictive performance of GCNs in real data. 

048__ Joint and Conditional Generation with Succinct Common  Representation Learning__arXiv:1905.10945
Author: J. Jon Ryu
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10945
 Abstract: A new variational autoencoder (VAE) model is proposed that learns a succinct common representation of two correlated data variables for conditional and joint generation tasks. The proposed Wyner VAE model is based on two information theoretic problems---distributed simulation and channel synthesis---in which Wyner's common information arises as the fundamental limit of the succinctness of the common representation. The Wyner VAE decomposes a pair of correlated data variables into their common representation (e.g., a shared concept) and local representations that capture the remaining randomness (e.g., texture and style) in respective data variables by imposing the mutual information between the data variables and the common representation as a regularization term. The utility of the proposed approach is demonstrated through experiments for joint and conditional generation with and without style control using synthetic data and real images. Experimental results show that learning a succinct common representation achieves better generative performance and that the proposed model outperforms existing VAE variants and the variational information bottleneck method. 

049__ Identity Connections in Residual Nets Improve Noise Stability__arXiv:1905.10944
Author: Shuzhi Yu
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10944
 Abstract: Residual Neural Networks (ResNets) achieve state-of-the-art performance in many computer vision problems. Compared to plain networks without residual connections (PlnNets), ResNets train faster, generalize better, and suffer less from the so-called degradation problem. We introduce simplified (but still nonlinear) versions of ResNets and PlnNets for which these discrepancies still hold, although to a lesser degree. We establish a 1-1 mapping between simplified ResNets and simplified PlnNets, and show that they are exactly equivalent to each other in expressive power for the same computational complexity. We conjecture that ResNets generalize better because they have better noise stability, and empirically support it for both simplified and fully-fledged networks. 

050__ Distributionally Robust Optimization and Generalization in Kernel  Methods__arXiv:1905.10943
Author: Matthew Staib
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10943
 Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) has attracted attention in machine learning due to its connections to regularization, generalization, and robustness. Existing work has considered uncertainty sets based on phi-divergences and Wasserstein distances, each of which have drawbacks. In this paper, we study DRO with uncertainty sets measured via maximum mean discrepancy (MMD). We show that MMD DRO is roughly equivalent to regularization by the Hilbert norm and, as a byproduct, reveal deep connections to classic results in statistical learning. In particular, we obtain an alternative proof of a generalization bound for Gaussian kernel ridge regression via a DRO lense. The proof also suggests a new regularizer. Our results apply beyond kernel methods: we derive a generically applicable approximation of MMD DRO, and show that it generalizes recent work on variance-based regularization. 

051__ Communication-Efficient Distributed Blockwise Momentum SGD with  Error-Feedback__arXiv:1905.10936
Author: Shuai Zheng
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10936
 Abstract: Communication overhead is a major bottleneck hampering the scalability of distributed machine learning systems. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in using gradient compression to improve the communication efficiency of distributed neural network training. Using 1-bit quantization, signSGD with majority vote achieves a 32x reduction on communication cost. However, its convergence is based on unrealistic assumptions and can diverge in practice. In this paper, we propose a general distributed compressed SGD with Nesterov's momentum. We consider two-way compression, which compresses the gradients both to and from workers. Convergence analysis on nonconvex problems for general gradient compressors is provided. By partitioning the gradient into blocks, a blockwise compressor is introduced such that each gradient block is compressed and transmitted in 1-bit format with a scaling factor, leading to a nearly 32x reduction on communication. Experimental results show that the proposed method converges as fast as full-precision distributed momentum SGD and achieves the same testing accuracy. In particular, on distributed ResNet training with 7 workers on the ImageNet, the proposed algorithm achieves the same testing accuracy as momentum SGD using full-precision gradients, but with $46\%$ less wall clock time. 

052__ Sequential Graph Dependency Parser__arXiv:1905.10930
Author: Sean Welleck
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10930
 Abstract: We propose a method for non-projective dependency parsing by incrementally predicting a set of edges. Since the edges do not have a pre-specified order, we propose a set-based learning method. Our method blends graph, transition, and easy-first parsing, including a prior state of the parser as a special case. The proposed transition-based method successfully parses near the state of the art on both projective and non-projective languages, without assuming a certain parsing order. 

053__ Magnetoresistive RAM for error resilient XNOR-Nets__arXiv:1905.10927
Author: Michail Tzoufras
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10927
 Abstract: We trained three Binarized Convolutional Neural Network architectures (LeNet-4, Network-In-Network, AlexNet) on a variety of datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, extended SVHN, ImageNet) using error-prone activations and tested them without errors to study the resilience of the training process. With the exception of the AlexNet when trained on the ImageNet dataset, we found that Bit Error Rates of a few percent during training do not degrade the test accuracy. Furthermore, by training the AlexNet on progressively smaller subsets of ImageNet classes, we observed increasing tolerance to activation errors. The ability to operate with high BERs is critical for reducing power consumption in existing hardware and for facilitating emerging memory technologies. We discuss how operating at moderate BER can enable Magnetoresistive RAM with higher endurance, speed and density. 

054__ Temporal-difference learning for nonlinear value function approximation  in the lazy training regime__arXiv:1905.10917
Author: Andrea Agazzi
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10917
 Abstract: We discuss the approximation of the value function for infinite-horizon discounted Markov Decision Processes (MDP) with nonlinear functions trained with Temporal-Difference (TD) learning algorithm. We consider this problem under a certain scaling of the approximating function, leading to a regime called lazy training. In this regime the parameters of the model vary only slightly during the learning process, a feature that has recently been observed in the training of neural networks, where the scaling we study arises naturally, implicit in the initialization of their parameters. Both in the under- and over-parametrized frameworks, we prove exponential convergence to local, respectively global minimizers of the above algorithm in the lazy training regime. We then give examples of such convergence results in the case of models that diverge if trained with non-lazy TD learning, and in the case of neural networks. 

055__ Defining Quantum Neural Networks via Quantum Time Evolution__arXiv:1905.10912
Author: Aditya Dendukuri
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10912
 Abstract: This work presents a novel fundamental algorithm for for defining and training Neural Networks in Quantum Information based on time evolution and the Hamiltonian. Classical Neural Network algorithms (ANN) are computationally expensive. For example, in image classification, representing an image pixel by pixel using classical information requires an enormous amount of computational memory resources. Hence, exploring methods to represent images in a different paradigm of information is important. Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) have been explored for over 20 years. The current forefront work based on Variational Quantum Circuits is specifically defined for the Continuous Variable (CV) Model of quantum computers. In this work, a model is proposed which is defined at a more fundamental level and hence can be inherited by any variants of quantum computing models. This work also presents a quantum backpropagation algorithm to train our QNN model and validate this algorithm on the MNIST dataset on a quantum computer simulation. 

056__ Non-Determinism in Neural Networks for Adversarial Robustness__arXiv:1905.10906
Author: Daanish Ali Khan
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10906
 Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in the field of deep learning have led to advancements in a broad spectrum of tasks in computer vision, audio processing, natural language processing and other areas. In most instances where these tasks are deployed in real-world scenarios, the models used in them have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial attacks, making it imperative for us to address the challenge of their adversarial robustness. Existing techniques for adversarial robustness fall into three broad categories: defensive distillation techniques, adversarial training techniques, and randomized or non-deterministic model based techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network paradigm that falls under the category of randomized models for adversarial robustness, but differs from all existing techniques under this category in that it models each parameter of the network as a statistical distribution with learnable parameters. We show experimentally that this framework is highly robust to a variety of white-box and black-box adversarial attacks, while preserving the task-specific performance of the traditional neural network model. 

057__ Robust Classification using Robust Feature Augmentation__arXiv:1905.10904
Author: Kevin Eykholt
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10904
 Abstract: Existing deep neural networks, say for image classification, have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial images that can cause a DNN misclassification, without any perceptible change to an image. In this work, we propose shock absorbing robust features such as binarization, e.g., rounding, and group extraction, e.g., color or shape, to augment the classification pipeline, resulting in more robust classifiers. Experimentally, we show that augmenting ML models with these techniques leads to improved overall robustness on adversarial inputs as well as significant improvements in training time. On the MNIST dataset, we achieved 14x speedup in training time to obtain 90% adversarial accuracy com-pared to the state-of-the-art adversarial training method of Madry et al., as well as retained higher adversarial accuracy over a broader range of attacks. We also find robustness improvements on traffic sign classification using robust feature augmentation. Finally, we give theoretical insights for why one can expect robust feature augmentation to reduce adversarial input space 

058__ An Abstract Algebraic Interpretation of Convolutional Neural Networks__arXiv:1905.10901
Author: Andrew Hryniowski
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10901
 Abstract: Researchers are actively trying to gain better insights into the representational properties of convolutional neural networks for guiding better network designs and for interpreting a network's computational nature. Gaining such insights can be an arduous task due to the number of parameters in a network and the complexity of a network's architecture. Current approaches of neural network interpretation include Bayesian probabilistic interpretations and information theoretic interpretations. In this study, we take a different approach to studying convolutional neural networks by proposing an abstract algebraic interpretation using finite transformation semigroup theory. Specifically, convolutional layers are broken up and mapped to a finite space. The state space of the proposed finite transformation semigroup is then defined as a single element within the convolutional layer, with the acting elements defined by surrounding state elements combined with convolution kernel elements. Generators of the finite transformation semigroup are defined to complete the interpretation. We leverage this approach to analyze the basic properties of the resulting finite transformation semigroup to gain insights on the representational properties of convolutional neural networks, including insights into quantized network representation. Such a finite transformation semigroup interpretation can also enable better understanding outside of the confines of fixed lattice data structures, thus useful for handling data that lie on irregular lattices. Furthermore, the proposed abstract algebraic interpretation is shown to be viable for interpreting convolutional operations within a variety of convolutional neural network architectures. 

059__ Enhancing ML Robustness Using Physical-World Constraints__arXiv:1905.10900
Author: Varun Chandrasekaran
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10900
 Abstract: Recent advances in Machine Learning (ML) have demonstrated that neural networks can exceed human performance in many tasks. While generalizing well over natural inputs, neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial inputs -an input that is ``similar'' to the original input, but misclassified by the model. Existing defenses focus on Lp-norm bounded adversaries that perturb ML inputs in the digital space. In the real world, however, attackers can generate adversarial perturbations that have a large Lp-norm in the digital space. Additionally, these defenses also come at a cost to accuracy, making their applicability questionable in the real world. To defend models against such a powerful adversary, we leverage one constraint on its power: the perturbation should not change the human's perception of the physical information; the physical world places some constraints on the space of possible attacks. Two questions follow: how to extract and model these constraints? and how to design a classification paradigm that leverages these constraints to improve robustness accuracy trade-off? We observe that an ML model is typically a part of a larger system with access to different input modalities. Utilizing these modalities, we introduce invariants that limit the attacker's action space. We design a hierarchical classification paradigm that enforces these invariants at inference time. As a case study, we implement and evaluate our proposal in the context of the real-world application of road sign classification because of its applicability to autonomous driving. With access to different input modalities, such as LiDAR, camera, and location we show how to extract invariants and develop a hierarchical classifier. Our results on the KITTI and GTSRB datasets show that we can improve the robustness against physical attacks at minimal harm to accuracy.

 Abstract: Despite remarkable empirical success, the training dynamics of generative adversarial networks (GAN), which involves solving a minimax game using stochastic gradients, is still poorly understood. In this work, we analyze last-iterate convergence of simultaneous gradient descent (simGD) and its variants under the assumption of convex-concavity, guided by a continuous-time analysis with differential equations. First, we show that simGD, as is, converges with stochastic sub-gradients under strict convexity in the primal variable. Second, we generalize optimistic simGD to accommodate an optimism rate separate from the learning rate and show its convergence with full gradients. Finally, we present anchored simGD, a new method, and show convergence with stochastic subgradients. 

061__ Classification Accuracy Score for Conditional Generative Models__arXiv:1905.10887
Author: Suman Ravuri
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10887
 Abstract: Deep generative models (DGMs) of images are now sufficiently mature that they produce nearly photorealistic samples and obtain scores similar to the data distribution on heuristics such as Frechet Inception Distance. These results, especially on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet, suggest that DGMs are learning the data distribution in a perceptually meaningful space, and can be used in downstream tasks. To test this latter hypothesis, we use class-conditional generative models from a number of model classes---variational autoencoder, autoregressive models, and generative adversarial networks---to infer the class labels of real data. We perform this inference by training the image classifier using only synthetic data, and using the classifier to predict labels on real data. The performance on this task, which we call Classification Accuracy Score (CAS), highlights some surprising results not captured by traditional metrics and comprise our contributions. First, when using a state-of-the-art GAN (BigGAN), Top-5 accuracy decreases by 41.6% compared to the original data and conditional generative models from other model classes, such as high-resolution VQ-VAE and Hierarchical Autoregressive Models, substantially outperform GANs on this benchmark. Second, CAS automatically surfaces particular classes for which generative models failed to capture the data distribution, and were previously unknown in the literature. Third, we find traditional GAN metrics such as Frechet Inception Distance neither predictive of CAS nor useful when evaluating non-GAN models. Finally, we introduce Naive Augmentation Score, a variant of CAS where the image classifier is trained on both real and synthetic data, to demonstrate that naive augmentation improves classification performance in limited circumstances. In order to facilitate better diagnoses of generative models, we open-source the proposed metric. 

062__ Unsupervised Domain Adaptation via Regularized Conditional Alignment__arXiv:1905.10885
Author: Safa Cicek
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10885
 Abstract: We propose a method for unsupervised domain adaptation that trains a shared embedding to align the joint distributions of inputs (domain) and outputs (classes), making any classifier agnostic to the domain. Joint alignment ensures that not only the marginal distributions of the domain are aligned, but the labels as well. We propose a novel objective function that encourages the class-conditional distributions to have disjoint support in feature space. We further exploit adversarial regularization to improve the performance of the classifier on the domain for which no annotated data is available. 

063__ Bayesian Learning of Sum-Product Networks__arXiv:1905.10884
Author: Martin Trapp
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10884
 Abstract: Sum-product networks (SPNs) are flexible density estimators and have received significant attention, due to their attractive inference properties. While parameter learning in SPNs is well developed, structure learning leaves something to be desired: Even though there is a plethora of SPN structure learners, most of them are somewhat ad-hoc, and based on intuition rather than a clear learning principle. In this paper, we introduce a well-principled Bayesian framework for SPN structure learning. First, we decompose the problem into i) laying out a basic computational graph, and ii) learning the so-called scope function over the graph. The first is rather unproblematic and akin to neural network architecture validation. The second characterises the effective structure of the SPN and needs to respect the usual structural constraints in SPN, i.e. completeness and decomposability. While representing and learning the scope function is rather involved in general, in this paper, we propose a natural parametrisation for an important and widely used special case of SPNs. These structural parameters are incorporated into a Bayesian model, such that simultaneous structure and parameter learning is cast into monolithic Bayesian posterior inference. In various experiments, our Bayesian SPNs often improve test likelihoods over greedy SPN learners. Further, since the Bayesian framework protects against overfitting, we are able to evaluate hyper-parameters directly on the Bayesian model score, waiving the need for a separate validation set, which is especially beneficial in low data regimes. Bayesian SPNs can be applied to heterogeneous domains and can easily be extended to nonparametric formulations. Moreover, our Bayesian approach is the first which consistently and robustly learns SPN structures under missing data. 

064__ Generalizable Adversarial Attacks Using Generative Models__arXiv:1905.10864
Author: Avishek Joey Bose
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10864
 Abstract: Adversarial attacks on deep neural networks traditionally rely on a constrained optimization paradigm, where an optimization procedure is used to obtain a single adversarial perturbation for a given input example. Here, we instead view adversarial attacks as a generative modelling problem, with the goal of producing entire distributions of adversarial examples given an unperturbed input. We show that this generative perspective can be used to design a unified encoder-decoder framework, which is \textit{domain-agnostic} in that the same framework can be employed to attack different domains with minimal modification. Across three diverse domains---images, text, and graphs---our approach generates whitebox attacks with success rates that are competitive with or superior to existing approaches, with a new state-of-the-art achieved in the graph domain. Finally, we demonstrate that our generative framework can efficiently generate a diverse set of attacks for a single given input, and is even capable of attacking \textit{unseen} test instances in a zero-shot manner, exhibiting {\em attack generalization. 

065__ Causal Discovery and Forecasting in Nonstationary Environments with  State-Space Models__arXiv:1905.10857
Author: Biwei Huang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10857
 Abstract: In many scientific fields, such as economics and neuroscience, we are often faced with nonstationary time series, and concerned with both finding causal relations and forecasting the values of variables of interest, both of which are particularly challenging in such nonstationary environments. In this paper, we study causal discovery and forecasting for nonstationary time series. By exploiting a particular type of state-space model to represent the processes, we show that nonstationarity helps to identify causal structure and that forecasting naturally benefits from learned causal knowledge. Specifically, we allow changes in both causal strengths and noise variances in the nonlinear state-space models, which, interestingly, renders both the causal structure and model parameters identifiable. Given the causal model, we treat forecasting as a problem in Bayesian inference in the causal model, which exploits the time-varying property of the data and adapts to new observations in a principled manner. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods. 

066__ All Neural Networks are Created Equal__arXiv:1905.10854
Author: Guy Hacohen
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10854
 Abstract: One of the unresolved questions in the context of deep learning is the triumph of GD based optimization, which is guaranteed to converge to one of many local minima. To shed light on the nature of the solutions that are thus being discovered, we investigate the ensemble of solutions reached by the same network architecture, with different random initialization of weights and random mini-batches. Surprisingly, we observe that these solutions are in fact very similar - more often than not, each train and test example is either classified correctly by all the networks, or by none at all. Moreover, all the networks seem to share the same learning dynamics, whereby initially the same train and test examples are incorporated into the learnt model, followed by other examples which are learnt in roughly the same order. When different neural network architectures are compared, the same learning dynamics is observed even when one architecture is significantly stronger than the other and achieves higher accuracy. Finally, when investigating other methods that involve the gradual refinement of a solution, such as boosting, once again we see the same learning pattern. In all cases, it appears as if all the classifiers start by learning to classify correctly the same train and test examples, while the more powerful classifiers continue to learn to classify correctly additional examples. These results are incredibly robust, observed for a large variety of architectures, hyperparameters and different datasets of images. Thus we observe that different classification solutions may be discovered by different means, but typically they evolve in roughly the same manner and demonstrate a similar success and failure behavior. For a given dataset, such behavior seems to be strongly correlated with effective generalization, while the induced ranking of examples may reflect inherent structure in the data. 

067__ On Coresets for Regularized Loss Minimization__arXiv:1905.10845
Author: Ryan Curtain
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10845
 Abstract: We design and mathematically analyze sampling-based algorithms for regularized loss minimization problems that are implementable in popular computational models for large data, in which the access to the data is restricted in some way. Our main result is that if the regularizer's effect does not become negligible as the norm of the hypothesis scales, and as the data scales, then a uniform sample of modest size is with high probability a coreset. In the case that the loss function is either logistic regression or soft-margin support vector machines, and the regularizer is one of the common recommended choices, this result implies that a uniform sample of size $O(d \sqrt{n})$ is with high probability a coreset of $n$ points in $\Re^d$. We contrast this upper bound with two lower bounds. The first lower bound shows that our analysis of uniform sampling is tight; that is, a smaller uniform sample will likely not be a core set. The second lower bound shows that in some sense uniform sampling is close to optimal, as significantly smaller core sets do not generally exist. 

068__ Networks naturally learn to learn__arXiv:1905.10837
Author: Guy Davidson
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10837
 Abstract: We explore the behavior of a standard convolutional neural net in a setting that introduces classification tasks sequentially and requires the net to master new tasks while preserving mastery of previously learned tasks. This setting corresponds to that which human learners face as they acquire domain expertise, for example, as an individual reads a textbook chapter-by-chapter. Through simulations involving sequences of ten related tasks, we find reason for optimism that nets will scale well as they advance from having a single skill to becoming domain experts. We observed two key phenomena. First, _forward facilitation_---the accelerated learning of task $n+1$ having learned $n$ previous tasks---grows with $n$. Second, _backward interference_---the forgetting of the $n$ previous tasks when learning task $n+1$---diminishes with $n$. Amplifying forward facilitation is the goal of research on metalearning, and attenuating backward interference is the goal of research on catastrophic forgetting. We find that both of these goals are attained simply through broader exposure to a domain. 

069__ A Functional  Approximation Prospective__arXiv:1905.10826
Author: Lili Su
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10826
 Abstract: We consider training over-parameterized two-layer neural networks with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) using gradient descent (GD) method. Inspired by a recent line of work, we study the evolutions of the network prediction errors across GD iterations, which can be neatly described in a matrix form. It turns out that when the network is sufficiently over-parameterized, these matrices individually approximate an integral operator which is determined by the feature vector distribution $\rho$ only. Consequently, GD method can be viewed as approximately apply the powers of this integral operator on the underlying/target function $f^*$ that generates the responses/labels. We show that if $f^*$ admits a low-rank approximation with respect to the eigenspaces of this integral operator, then, even with constant stepsize, the empirical risk decreases to this low-rank approximation error at a linear rate in iteration $t$. In addition, this linear rate is determined by $f^*$ and $\rho$ only. Furthermore, if $f^*$ has zero low-rank approximation error, then $\Omega(n^2)$ network over-parameterization is enough, and the empirical risk decreases to $\Theta(1/\sqrt{n})$. We provide an application of our general results to the setting where $\rho$ is the uniform distribution on the spheres and $f^*$ is a polynomial. 

070__ Phase Transitions and Cyclic Phenomena in Bandits with Switching  Constraints__arXiv:1905.10825
Author: David Simchi-Levi
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10825
 Abstract: We consider the classical stochastic multi-armed bandit problem with a constraint on the total cost incurred by switching between actions. We prove matching upper and lower bounds on regret and provide near-optimal algorithms for this problem. Surprisingly, we discover phase transitions and cyclic phenomena of the optimal regret. That is, we show that associated with the multi-armed bandit problem, there are phases defined by the number of arms and switching costs, where the regret upper and lower bounds in each phase remain the same and drop significantly between phases. The results enable us to fully characterize the trade-off between regret and incurred switching cost in the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem, contributing new insights to this fundamental problem. Under the general switching cost structure, the results reveal a deep connection between bandit problems and graph traversal problems, such as the shortest Hamiltonian path problem. 

071__ Nonparametric Online Learning Using Lipschitz Regularized Deep Neural  Networks__arXiv:1905.10821
Author: Guy Uziel
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10821
 Abstract: Deep neural networks are considered to be state of the art models in many offline machine learning tasks. However, their performance and generalization abilities in online learning tasks are much less understood. Therefore, we focus on online learning and tackle the challenging problem where the underlying process is stationary and ergodic and thus removing the i.i.d. assumption and allowing observations to depend on each other arbitrarily. We prove the generalization abilities of Lipschitz regularized deep neural networks and show that by using those networks, a convergence to the best possible prediction strategy is guaranteed. 

072__ Frugal Training with  Generalization Guarantees__arXiv:1905.10819
Author: Maria-Florina Balcan
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10819
 Abstract: Algorithms typically come with tunable parameters that have a considerable impact on the computational resources they consume. Too often, practitioners must hand-tune the parameters, a tedious and error-prone task. A recent line of research provides algorithms that return nearly-optimal parameters from within a finite set. These algorithms can be used when the parameter space is infinite by providing as input a random sample of parameters. This data-independent discretization, however, might miss pockets of nearly-optimal parameters: prior research has presented scenarios where the only viable parameters lie within an arbitrarily small region. We provide an algorithm that learns a finite set of promising parameters from within an infinite set. Our algorithm can help compile a configuration portfolio, or it can be used to select the input to a configuration algorithm for finite parameter spaces. Our approach applies to any configuration problem that satisfies a simple yet ubiquitous structure: the algorithm's performance is a piecewise constant function of its parameters. Prior research has exhibited this structure in domains from integer programming to clustering. For these types of combinatorial problems, this is the first configuration algorithm beyond exhaustive search whose output provably competes with the best parameters from an infinite space. 

073__ Deep Online Learning with Stochastic Constraints__arXiv:1905.10817
Author: Guy Uziel
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10817
 Abstract: Deep learning models are considered to be state-of-the-art in many offline machine learning tasks. However, many of the techniques developed are not suitable for online learning tasks. The problem of using deep learning models with sequential data becomes even harder when several loss functions need to be considered simultaneously, as in many real-world applications. In this paper, we, therefore, propose a novel online deep learning training procedure which can be used regardless of the neural network's architecture, aiming to deal with the multiple objectives case. We demonstrate and show the effectiveness of our algorithm on the Neyman-Pearson classification problem on several benchmark datasets. 

074__ Hyperbolic Interaction Model For Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification__arXiv:1905.10802
Author: Boli Chen
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10802
 Abstract: Different from the traditional classification tasks which assume mutual exclusion of labels, hierarchical multi-label classification (HMLC) aims to assign multiple labels to every instance with the labels organized under hierarchical relations. In fact, linguistic ontologies are intrinsic hierarchies. Besides the labels, the conceptual relations between words can also form hierarchical structures. Thus it can be a challenge to learn mappings from the word space to the label space, and vice versa. We propose to model the word and label hierarchies by embedding them jointly in the hyperbolic space. The main reason is that the tree-likeness of the hyperbolic space matches the complexity of symbolic data with hierarchical structures. A new hyperbolic interaction model (HyperIM) is designed to learn the label-aware document representations and make predictions for HMLC. Extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmark datasets. The results have demonstrated that the new model can realistically capture the complex data structures and further improve the performance for HMLC comparing with the state-of-the-art methods. To facilitate future research, our code is publicly available. 

075__ A Flexible Generative Framework for Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning__arXiv:1905.10769
Author: Jiaqi Ma
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10769
 Abstract: We consider a family of problems that are concerned about making predictions for the majority of unlabeled, graph-structured data samples based on a small proportion of labeled examples. Relational information among the data samples, often encoded in the graph or network structure, is shown to be helpful for these semi-supervised learning tasks. Conventional graph-based regularization methods and recent graph neural networks do not fully leverage the interrelations between the features, the graph, and the labels. We propose a flexible generative framework for graph-based semi-supervised learning, which approaches the joint distribution of the node features, labels, and the graph structure. Borrowing insights from random graph models in network science literature, this joint distribution can be instantiated using various distribution families. For the inference of missing labels, we exploit recent advances of scalable variational inference techniques to approximate the Bayesian posterior. We conduct thorough experiments on benchmark datasets for graph-based semi-supervised learning. Results show that the proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art models under most settings. 

076__ Evaluating Generative Models Using Divergence Frontiers__arXiv:1905.10768
Author: Josip Djolonga
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10768
 Abstract: Despite the tremendous progress in the estimation of generative models, the development of tools for diagnosing their failures and assessing their performance has advanced at a much slower pace. Recent developments have investigated metrics that quantify which parts of the true distribution are modeled well, and, on the contrary, what the model fails to capture, akin to precision and recall in information retrieval. In this paper, we present a general evaluation framework for generative models that measures the trade-off between precision and recall using R\'enyi divergences. Our framework provides a novel perspective on existing techniques and extends them to more general domains. As a key advantage, it allows for efficient algorithms that are directly applicable to continuous distributions directly without discretization. We further showcase the proposed techniques on a set of image synthesis models. 

077__ A Probabilistic Activation Function for Deep Neural Networks__arXiv:1905.10761
Author: Joonho Lee
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10761
 Abstract: Activation functions play an important role in the training of artificial neural networks and the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) has been the mainstream in recent years. Most of the activation functions currently used are deterministic in nature, whose input-output relationship is fixed. In this work, we propose a probabilistic activation function, called ProbAct. The output value of ProbAct is sampled from a normal distribution, with the mean value same as the output of ReLU and with a fixed or trainable variance for each element. In the trainable ProbAct, the variance of the activation distribution is trained through back-propagation. We also show that the stochastic perturbation through ProbAct is a viable generalization technique that can prevent overfitting. In our experiments, we demonstrate that when using ProbAct, it is possible to boost the image classification performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and STL-10 datasets. 

078__ Deep Domain Adaptation for Cross-Domain Recommendation via  Transferring Rating Patterns__arXiv:1905.10760
Author: Feng Yuan
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10760
 Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation has long been one of the major topics in recommender systems. Recently, various deep models have been proposed to transfer the learned knowledge across domains, but most of them focus on extracting abstract transferable features from auxilliary contents, e.g., images and review texts, and the patterns in the rating matrix itself is rarely touched. In this work, inspired by the concept of domain adaptation, we proposed a deep domain adaptation model (DARec) that is capable of extracting and transferring patterns from rating matrices {\em only} without relying on any auxillary information. We empirically demonstrate on public datasets that our method achieves the best performance among several state-of-the-art alternative cross-domain recommendation models. 

079__ Stochastic Gradient Methods with Block Diagonal Matrix Adaptation__arXiv:1905.10757
Author: Jihun Yun
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10757
 Abstract: Adaptive gradient approaches that automatically adjust the learning rate on a per-feature basis have been very popular for training deep networks. This rich class of algorithms includes Adagrad, RMSprop, Adam, and recent extensions. All these algorithms have adopted diagonal matrix adaptation, due to the prohibitive computational burden of manipulating full matrices in high-dimensions. In this paper, we show that block-diagonal matrix adaptation can be a practical and powerful solution that can effectively utilize structural characteristics of deep learning architectures, and significantly improve convergence and out-of-sample generalization. We present a general framework with block-diagonal matrix updates via coordinate grouping, which includes counterparts of the aforementioned algorithms, prove their convergence in non-convex optimization, highlighting benefits compared to diagonal versions. In addition, we propose an efficient spectrum-clipping scheme that benefits from superior generalization performance of Sgd. Extensive experiments reveal that block-diagonal approaches achieve state-of-the-art results on several deep learning tasks, and can outperform adaptive diagonal methods, vanilla Sgd, as well as a modified version of full-matrix adaptation proposed very recently. 

080__ Selective Transfer with Reinforced Transfer Network for Partial Domain  Adaptation__arXiv:1905.10756
Author: Zhihong Chen
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10756
 Abstract: Partial domain adaptation (PDA) extends standard domain adaptation to a more realistic scenario where the target domain only has a subset of classes from the source domain. The key challenge of PDA is how to select the relevant samples in the shared classes for knowledge transfer. Previous PDA methods tackle this problem by re-weighting the source samples based on the prediction of classifier or discriminator, thus discarding the pixel-level information. In this paper, to utilize both high-level and pixel-level information, we propose a reinforced transfer network (RTNet), which is the first work to apply reinforcement learning to address the PDA problem. The RTNet simultaneously mitigates the negative transfer by adopting a reinforced data selector to filter out outlier source classes, and promotes the positive transfer by employing a domain adaptation model to minimize the distribution discrepancy in the shared label space. Extensive experiments indicate that RTNet can achieve state-of-the-art performance for partial domain adaptation tasks on several benchmark datasets. Codes and datasets will be available online. 

081__ A Deep Learning Based Viterbi Algorithm for Symbol Detection__arXiv:1905.10750
Author: Nir Shlezinger
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10750
 Abstract: Symbol detection plays an important role in the implementation of digital receivers. In this work, we propose ViterbiNet, which is a data-driven symbol detector that does not require channel state information (CSI). ViterbiNet is obtained by integrating deep neural networks (DNNs) into the Viterbi algorithm. We identify the specific parts of the Viterbi algorithm that are channel-model-based, and design a DNN to implement only those computations, leaving the rest of the algorithm structure intact. We then propose a meta-learning based approach to train ViterbiNet online based on recent decisions, allowing the receiver to track dynamic channel conditions without requiring new training samples for every coherence block. Our numerical evaluations demonstrate that the performance of ViterbiNet, which is ignorant of the CSI, approaches that of the CSI-based Viterbi algorithm, and is capable of tracking time-varying channels without needing instantaneous CSI or additional training data. Moreover, unlike conventional Viterbi detection, ViterbiNet is robust to CSI uncertainty, and it can be reliably implemented in complex channel models with constrained computational burden. More broadly, our results demonstrate the conceptual benefit of designing communication systems to that integrate DNNs into established algorithms.

 Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved impressive results on a wide variety of tasks. However, quantifying uncertainty in the network's output is a challenging task. Bayesian models offer a mathematical framework to reason about model uncertainty. Variational methods have been used for approximating intractable integrals that arise in Bayesian inference for neural networks. In this report, we review the major variational inference concepts pertinent to Bayesian neural networks and compare various approximation methods used in literature. We also talk about the applications of variational bayes in Reinforcement learning and continual learning. 

083__ Purifying Adversarial Perturbation with Adversarially Trained  Auto-encoders__arXiv:1905.10729
Author: Hebi Li
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10729
 Abstract: Machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples. Iterative adversarial training has shown promising results against strong white-box attacks. However, adversarial training is very expensive, and every time a model needs to be protected, such expensive training scheme needs to be performed. In this paper, we propose to apply iterative adversarial training scheme to an external auto-encoder, which once trained can be used to protect other models directly. We empirically show that our model outperforms other purifying-based methods against white-box attacks, and transfers well to directly protect other base models with different architectures. 

084__ Graph Attention Auto-Encoders__arXiv:1905.10715
Author: Amin Salehi
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10715
 Abstract: Auto-encoders have emerged as a successful framework for unsupervised learning. However, conventional auto-encoders are incapable of utilizing explicit relations in structured data. To take advantage of relations in graph-structured data, several graph auto-encoders have recently been proposed, but they neglect to reconstruct either the graph structure or node attributes. In this paper, we present the graph attention auto-encoder (GATE), a neural network architecture for unsupervised representation learning on graph-structured data. Our architecture is able to reconstruct graph-structured inputs, including both node attributes and the graph structure, through stacked encoder/decoder layers equipped with self-attention mechanisms. In the encoder, by considering node attributes as initial node representations, each layer generates new representations of nodes by attending over their neighbors' representations. In the decoder, we attempt to reverse the encoding process to reconstruct node attributes. Moreover, node representations are regularized to reconstruct the graph structure. Our proposed architecture does not need to know the graph structure upfront, and thus it can be applied to inductive learning. Our experiments demonstrate competitive performance on several node classification benchmark datasets for transductive and inductive tasks, even exceeding the performance of supervised learning baselines in most cases. 

085__ Dual Averaging Method for Online Graph-structured Sparsity__arXiv:1905.10714
Author: Baojian Zhou
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10714
 Abstract: Online learning algorithms update models via one sample per iteration, thus efficient to process large-scale datasets and useful to detect malicious events for social benefits, such as disease outbreak and traffic congestion on the fly. However, existing algorithms for graph-structured models focused on the offline setting and the least square loss, incapable for online setting, while methods designed for online setting cannot be directly applied to the problem of complex (usually non-convex) graph-structured sparsity model. To address these limitations, in this paper we propose a new algorithm for graph-structured sparsity constraint problems under online setting, which we call \textsc{GraphDA}. The key part in \textsc{GraphDA} is to project both averaging gradient (in dual space) and primal variables (in primal space) onto lower dimensional subspaces, thus capturing the graph-structured sparsity effectively. Furthermore, the objective functions assumed here are generally convex so as to handle different losses for online learning settings. To the best of our knowledge, \textsc{GraphDA} is the first online learning algorithm for graph-structure constrained optimization problems. To validate our method, we conduct extensive experiments on both benchmark graph and real-world graph datasets. Our experiment results show that, compared to other baseline methods, \textsc{GraphDA} not only improves classification performance, but also successfully captures graph-structured features more effectively, hence stronger interpretability. 

086__ field-aware  calibration with neural networks__arXiv:1905.10713
Author: Feiyang Pan
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10713
 Abstract: In machine learning, it is observed that probabilistic predictions sometimes disagree with averaged actual outcomes on certain subsets of data. This is also known as miscalibration that is responsible for unreliability and unfairness of practical machine learning systems. In this paper, we put forward an evaluation metric for calibration, coined field-level calibration error, that measures bias in predictions over the input fields that the decision maker concerns. We show that existing calibration methods perform poorly under our new metric. Specifically, after learning a calibration mapping over the validation dataset, existing methods have limited improvements in our error metric and completely fail to improve other non-calibration metrics such as the AUC score. We propose Neural Calibration, a new calibration method, which learns to calibrate by making full use of all input information over the validation set. We test our method on five large-scale real-world datasets. The results show that Neural Calibration significantly improves against uncalibrated predictions in all well-known metrics such as the negative log-likelihood, the Brier score, the AUC score, as well as our proposed field-level calibration error. 

087__ A Lipschitz-constrained anomaly discriminator framework__arXiv:1905.10710
Author: Alexander Tong
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10710
 Abstract: Anomaly detection is a problem of great interest in medicine, finance, and other fields where error and fraud need to be detected and corrected. Most deep anomaly detection methods rely on autoencoder reconstruction error. However, we show that this approach has limited value. First, this approach starts to perform poorly when either noise or anomalies contaminate training data, even to a small extent. Second, this approach cannot detect anomalous but simple to reconstruct points. This can be seen even in relatively simple examples, such as feeding a black image to detectors trained on MNIST digits. Here, we introduce a new discriminator-based unsupervised Lipschitz anomaly detector (LAD). We train a Wasserstein discriminator, similar to the ones used in GANs, to detect the difference between the training data and corruptions of the training data. We show that this procedure successfully detects unseen anomalies with guarantees on those that have a certain Wasserstein distance from the data or corrupted training set. Finally, we show results of this system in an electronic medical record dataset of HIV-positive veterans from the veterans aging cohort study (VACS) to establish usability in a medical setting. 

088__ Demand Forecasting from Spatiotemporal Data with Graph Networks and  Temporal-Guided Embedding__arXiv:1905.10709
Author: Doyup Lee
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10709
 Abstract: Short-term demand forecasting models commonly combine convolutional and recurrent layers to extract complex spatiotemporal patterns in data. Long-term histories are also used to consider periodicity and seasonality patterns as time series data. In this study, we propose an efficient architecture, Temporal-Guided Network (TGNet), which utilizes graph networks and temporal-guided embedding. Graph networks extract invariant features to permutations of adjacent regions instead of convolutional layers. Temporal-guided embedding explicitly learns temporal contexts from training data and is substituted for the input of long-term histories from days/weeks ago. TGNet learns an autoregressive model, conditioned on temporal contexts of forecasting targets from temporal-guided embedding. Finally, our model achieves competitive performances with other baselines on three spatiotemporal demand dataset from real-world, but the number of trainable parameters is about 20 times smaller than a state-of-the-art baseline. We also show that temporal-guided embedding learns temporal contexts as intended and TGNet has robust forecasting performances even to atypical event situations.

PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10706
 Abstract: Intelligent agents need a physical understanding of the world to predict the impact of their actions in the future. While learning-based models of the environment dynamics have contributed to significant improvements in sample efficiency compared to model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, they typically fail to generalize to system states beyond the training data, while often grounding their predictions on non-interpretable latent variables. We introduce Interactive Differentiable Simulation (IDS), a differentiable physics engine, that allows for efficient, accurate inference of physical properties of rigid-body systems. Integrated into deep learning architectures, our model is able to accomplish system identification using visual input, leading to an interpretable model of the world whose parameters have physical meaning. We present experiments showing automatic task-based robot design and parameter estimation for nonlinear dynamical systems by automatically calculating gradients in IDS. When integrated into an adaptive model-predictive control algorithm, our approach exhibits orders of magnitude improvements in sample efficiency over model-free reinforcement learning algorithms on challenging nonlinear control domains. 

090__ Image Detection and Digit Recognition to solve Sudoku as a Constraint  Satisfaction Problem__arXiv:1905.10701
Author: Aditya Narayanaswamy
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10701
 Abstract: Sudoku is a puzzle well-known to the scientific community with simple rules of completion, which may require a com-plex line of reasoning. This paper addresses the problem of partitioning the Sudoku image into a 1-D array, recognizing digits from the array and representing it as a Constraint Sat-isfaction Problem (CSP). In this paper, we introduce new fea-ture extraction techniques for recognizing digits, which are used with our benchmark classifiers in conjunction with the CSP algorithms to provide performance assessment. Experi-mental results show that application of CSP techniques can decrease the solution's search time by eliminating incon-sistent values from the search space. 

091__ Efficient Neural Task Adaptation by Maximum Entropy Initialization__arXiv:1905.10698
Author: Farshid Varno
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10698
 Abstract: Transferring knowledge from one neural network to another has been shown to be helpful for learning tasks with few training examples. Prevailing fine-tuning methods could potentially contaminate pre-trained features by comparably high energy random noise. This noise is mainly delivered from a careless replacement of task-specific parameters. We analyze theoretically such knowledge contamination for classification tasks and propose a practical and easy to apply method to trap and minimize the contaminant. In our approach, the entropy of the output estimates gets maximized initially and the first back-propagated error is stalled at the output of the last layer. Our proposed method not only outperforms the traditional fine-tuning, but also significantly speeds up the convergence of the learner. It is robust to randomness and independent of the choice of architecture. Overall, our experiments show that the power of transfer learning has been substantially underestimated so far. 

092__ Sparsity Yields Less Forgetting when  Learning Cumulatively__arXiv:1905.10696
Author: Alexander Ororbia
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10696
 Abstract: In lifelong learning systems, especially those based on artificial neural networks, one of the biggest obstacles is the severe inability to retain old knowledge as new information is encountered. This phenomenon is known as catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we present a new connectionist model, the Sequential Neural Coding Network, and its learning procedure, grounded in the neurocognitive theory of predictive coding. The architecture experiences significantly less forgetting as compared to standard neural models and outperforms a variety of previously proposed remedies and methods when trained across multiple task datasets in a stream-like fashion. The promising performance demonstrated in our experiments offers motivation that directly incorporating mechanisms prominent in real neuronal systems, such as competition, sparse activation patterns, and iterative input processing, can create viable pathways for tackling the challenge of lifelong machine learning. 

093__ Adversarial Distillation for Ordered Top-k Attacks__arXiv:1905.10695
Author: Zekun Zhang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10695
 Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially white-box targeted attacks. One scheme of learning attacks is to design a proper adversarial objective function that leads to the imperceptible perturbation for any test image (e.g., the Carlini-Wagner (C&W) method). Most methods address targeted attacks in the Top-1 manner. In this paper, we propose to learn ordered Top-k attacks (k>= 1) for image classification tasks, that is to enforce the Top-k predicted labels of an adversarial example to be the k (randomly) selected and ordered labels (the ground-truth label is exclusive). To this end, we present an adversarial distillation framework: First, we compute an adversarial probability distribution for any given ordered Top-k targeted labels with respect to the ground-truth of a test image. Then, we learn adversarial examples by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence together with the perturbation energy penalty, similar in spirit to the network distillation method. We explore how to leverage label semantic similarities in computing the targeted distributions, leading to knowledge-oriented attacks. In experiments, we thoroughly test Top-1 and Top-5 attacks in the ImageNet-1000 validation dataset using two popular DNNs trained with clean ImageNet-1000 train dataset, ResNet-50 and DenseNet-121. For both models, our proposed adversarial distillation approach outperforms the C&W method in the Top-1 setting, as well as other baseline methods. Our approach shows significant improvement in the Top-5 setting against a strong modified C&W method. 

094__ Safe Reinforcement Learning via Online Shielding__arXiv:1905.10691
Author: Osbert Bastani
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10691
 Abstract: Reinforcement learning is a promising approach to learning control policies for complex robotics tasks. A key challenge is ensuring safety of the learned control policy---e.g., that a walking robot does not fall over, or a quadcopter does not run into a wall. We focus on the setting where the dynamics are known, and the goal is to prove that a policy learned in simulation satisfies a given safety constraint. Existing approaches for ensuring safety suffer from a number of limitations---e.g., they do not scale to high-dimensional state spaces, or they only ensure safety for a fixed environment. We propose an approach based on shielding, which uses a backup controller to override the learned controller as necessary to ensure that safety holds. Rather than compute when to use the backup controller ahead-of-time, we perform this computation online. By doing so, we ensure that our approach is computationally efficient, and furthermore, can be used to ensure safety even in novel environments. We empirically demonstrate that our approach can ensure safety in experiments on cart-pole and on a bicycle with random obstacles. 

095__ A Deep Learning Approach to Semantic Data Type Detection__arXiv:1905.10688
Author: Madelon Hulsebos
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10688
 Abstract: Correctly detecting the semantic type of data columns is crucial for data science tasks such as automated data cleaning, schema matching, and data discovery. Existing data preparation and analysis systems rely on dictionary lookups and regular expression matching to detect semantic types. However, these matching-based approaches often are not robust to dirty data and only detect a limited number of types. We introduce Sherlock, a multi-input deep neural network for detecting semantic types. We train Sherlock on $686,765$ data columns retrieved from the VizNet corpus by matching $78$ semantic types from DBpedia to column headers. We characterize each matched column with $1,588$ features describing the statistical properties, character distributions, word embeddings, and paragraph vectors of column values. Sherlock achieves a support-weighted F$_1$ score of $0.89$, exceeding that of machine learning baselines, dictionary and regular expression benchmarks, and the consensus of crowdsourced annotations. 

096__ Composing Ensembles of Policies with Deep Reinforcement Learning__arXiv:1905.10681
Author: Ahmed H. Qureshi
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10681
 Abstract: Composition of elementary skills into complex behaviors to solve challenging problems is one of the key elements toward building intelligent machines. To date, there has been plenty of work on learning new policies or skills but almost no focus on composing them to perform complex decision-making. In this paper, we propose a policy ensemble composition framework that takes the robot's primitive policies and learns to compose them concurrently or sequentially through reinforcement learning. We evaluate our method in problems where traditional approaches either fail or exhibit high sample complexity to find a solution. We show that our method not only solves the problems that require both task and motion planning but also exhibits high data efficiency, which is currently one of the main limitations of reinforcement learning. 

097__ Optimal Rates and Low  Noise Acceleration__arXiv:1905.10680
Author: Kwang-Sung Jun
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10680
 Abstract: In this paper, we consider the nonparametric least square regression in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We propose a new randomized algorithm that has optimal generalization error bounds with respect to the square loss, closing a long-standing gap between upper and lower bounds. Moreover, we show that our algorithm has faster finite-time and asymptotic rates on problems where the Bayes risk with respect to the square loss is small. We state our results using standard tools from the theory of least square regression in RKHSs, namely, the decay of the eigenvalues of the associated integral operator and the complexity of the optimal predictor measured through the integral operator. 

098__ Improving the efficiency of deep metric learning  loss functions for optimal embedding__arXiv:1905.10675
Author: Alfonso Medela
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10675
 Abstract: Metric learning has become an attractive field for research on the latest years. Loss functions like contrastive loss, triplet loss or multi-class N-pair loss have made possible generating models capable of tackling complex scenarios with the presence of many classes and scarcity on the number of images per class not only work to build classifiers, but to many other applications where measuring similarity is the key. Deep Neural Networks trained via metric learning also offer the possibility to solve few-shot learning problems. Currently used state of the art loss functions such as triplet and contrastive loss functions, still suffer from slow convergence due to the selection of effective training samples that has been partially solved by the multi-class N-pair loss by simultaneously adding additional samples from the different classes. In this work, we extend triplet and multiclass-N-pair loss function by proposing the constellation loss metric where the distances among all class combinations are simultaneously learned. We have compared our constellation loss for visual class embedding showing that our loss function over-performs the other methods by obtaining more compact clusters while achieving better classification results. 

099__ Compositional Fairness Constraints for Graph Embeddings__arXiv:1905.10674
Author: Avishek Joey Bose
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10674
 Abstract: Learning high-quality node embeddings is a key building block for machine learning models that operate on graph data, such as social networks and recommender systems. However, existing graph embedding techniques are unable to cope with fairness constraints, e.g., ensuring that the learned representations do not correlate with certain attributes, such as age or gender. Here, we introduce an adversarial framework to enforce fairness constraints on graph embeddings. Our approach is {\em compositional}---meaning that it can flexibly accommodate different combinations of fairness constraints during inference. For instance, in the context of social recommendations, our framework would allow one user to request that their recommendations are invariant to both their age and gender, while also allowing another user to request invariance to just their age. Experiments on standard knowledge graph and recommender system benchmarks highlight the utility of our proposed framework. 

100__ Locality-Promoting Representation Learning__arXiv:1905.10661
Author: Johannes Schneider
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10661
 Abstract: This work investigates fundamental questions related to locating and defining features in convolutional neural networks (CNN). The theoretical investigations guided by the locality principle show that the relevance of locations within a representation decreases with distance from the center. This is aligned with empirical findings across multiple architectures such as VGG, ResNet, Inception, DenseNet and MobileNet. To leverage our insights, we introduce Locality-promoting Regularization (LOCO-REG). It yields accuracy gains across multiple architectures and datasets. 

101__ Eliciting and Enforcing Subjective Individual Fairness__arXiv:1905.10660
Author: Christopher Jung
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10660
 Abstract: We revisit the notion of individual fairness first proposed by Dwork et al. [2012], which asks that "similar individuals should be treated similarly". A primary difficulty with this definition is that it assumes a completely specified fairness metric for the task at hand. In contrast, we consider a framework for fairness elicitation, in which fairness is indirectly specified only via a sample of pairs of individuals who should be treated (approximately) equally on the task. We make no assumption that these pairs are consistent with any metric. We provide a provably convergent oracle-efficient algorithm for minimizing error subject to the fairness constraints, and prove generalization theorems for both accuracy and fairness. Since the constrained pairs could be elicited either from a panel of judges, or from particular individuals, our framework provides a means for algorithmically enforcing subjective notions of fairness. We report on preliminary findings of a behavioral study of subjective fairness using human-subject fairness constraints elicited on the COMPAS criminal recidivism dataset. 

102__ Large Scale Markov Decision Processes with Changing Rewards__arXiv:1905.10649
Author: Adrian Rivera Cardoso
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10649
 Abstract: We consider Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) where the rewards are unknown and may change in an adversarial manner. We provide an algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art regret bound of $O( \sqrt{\tau (\ln|S|+\ln|A|)T}\ln(T))$, where $S$ is the state space, $A$ is the action space, $\tau$ is the mixing time of the MDP, and $T$ is the number of periods. The algorithm's computational complexity is polynomial in $|S|$ and $|A|$ per period. We then consider a setting often encountered in practice, where the state space of the MDP is too large to allow for exact solutions. By approximating the state-action occupancy measures with a linear architecture of dimension $d\ll|S|$, we propose a modified algorithm with computational complexity polynomial in $d$. We also prove a regret bound for this modified algorithm, which to the best of our knowledge this is the first $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound for large scale MDPs with changing rewards. 

103__ Data-driven Regularization of Embedding  Layers__arXiv:1905.10630
Author: Liwei Wu
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10630
 Abstract: In deep neural nets, lower level embedding layers account for a large portion of the total number of parameters. Tikhonov regularization, graph-based regularization, and hard parameter sharing are approaches that introduce explicit biases into training in a hope to reduce statistical complexity. Alternatively, we propose stochastically shared embeddings (SSE), a data-driven approach to regularizing embedding layers, which stochastically transitions between embeddings during stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Because SSE integrates seamlessly with existing SGD algorithms, it can be used with only minor modifications when training large scale neural networks. We develop two versions of SSE: SSE-Graph using knowledge graphs of embeddings; SSE-SE using no prior information. We provide theoretical guarantees for our method and show its empirical effectiveness on 6 distinct tasks, from simple neural networks with one hidden layer in recommender systems, to the transformer and BERT in natural languages. We find that when used along with widely-used regularization methods such as weight decay and dropout, our proposed SSE can further reduce overfitting, which often leads to more favorable generalization results. 

104__ Rethinking Softmax Cross-Entropy Loss for Adversarial Robustness__arXiv:1905.10626
Author: Tianyu Pang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10626
 Abstract: Previous work shows that adversarially robust generalization requires larger sample complexity, and the same dataset, e.g., CIFAR-10, which enables good standard accuracy may not suffice to train robust models. Since collecting new training data could be costly, we instead focus on inducing locally dense sample distribution, i.e., high sample density in the feature space which could lead to locally sufficient samples for robust learning. We first formally show that the softmax cross-entropy (SCE) loss and its variants induce inappropriate sample density distributions in the feature space, which inspires us to design appropriate training objectives. Specifically, we propose the Max-Mahalanobis center (MMC) loss to create high-density regions for better robustness. It encourages the learned features to gather around the preset class centers with optimal inter-class dispersion. Comparing to the SCE loss and its variants, we empirically demonstrate that applying the MMC loss can significantly improve robustness even under strong adaptive attacks, while keeping state-of-the-art accuracy on clean inputs with little extra computation. 

105__ Quantifying Exposure Bias for Neural Language Generation__arXiv:1905.10617
Author: Tianxing He
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10617
 Abstract: The exposure bias problem refers to the training-inference discrepancy caused by teacher forcing in maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) training for recurrent neural network language models (RNNLM). It has been regarded as a central problem for natural language generation (NLG) model training. Although a lot of algorithms have been proposed to avoid teacher forcing and therefore to remove exposure bias, there is little work showing how serious the exposure bias problem is. In this work, starting from the definition of exposure bias, we propose two simple and intuitive approaches to quantify exposure bias for MLE-trained language models. Experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real data-sets. Surprisingly, our results indicate that either exposure bias is trivial (i.e. indistinguishable from the mismatch between model and data distribution), or is not as significant as it is presumed to be (with a measured performance gap of 3%). With this work, we suggest re-evaluating the viewpoint that teacher forcing or exposure bias is a major drawback of MLE training. 

106__ Attacking Deep Reinforcement Learning__arXiv:1905.10615
Author: Adam Gleave
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10615
 Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) policies are known to be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations to their observations, similar to adversarial examples for classifiers. However, an attacker is not usually able to directly modify another agent's observations. This might lead one to wonder: is it possible to attack an RL agent simply by choosing an adversarial policy acting in a multi-agent environment so as to create natural observations that are adversarial? We demonstrate the existence of adversarial policies in zero-sum games between simulated humanoid robots with proprioceptive observations, against state-of-the-art victims trained via self-play to be robust to opponents. The adversarial policies reliably win against the victims but generate seemingly random and uncoordinated behavior. We find that these policies are more successful in high-dimensional environments, and induce substantially different activations in the victim policy network than when the victim plays against a normal opponent.

107__ Algorithms, Generalization and Experiments__arXiv:1905.10607
Author: Michael Kearns
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10607
 Abstract: We propose a new family of fairness definitions for classification problems that combine some of the best properties of both statistical and individual notions of fairness. We posit not only a distribution over individuals, but also a distribution over (or collection of) classification tasks. We then ask that standard statistics (such as error or false positive/negative rates) be (approximately) equalized across individuals, where the rate is defined as an expectation over the classification tasks. Because we are no longer averaging over coarse groups (such as race or gender), this is a semantically meaningful individual-level constraint. Given a sample of individuals and classification problems, we design an oracle-efficient algorithm (i.e. one that is given access to any standard, fairness-free learning heuristic) for the fair empirical risk minimization task. We also show that given sufficiently many samples, the ERM solution generalizes in two directions: both to new individuals, and to new classification tasks, drawn from their corresponding distributions. Finally we implement our algorithm and empirically verify its effectiveness. 

108__ speeding up deep neural network inferencing via look-up tables__arXiv:1905.10601
Author: Chai Wah Wu
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10601
 Abstract: We consider the use of look-up tables (LUT) to speed up and simplify the hardware implementation of a deep learning network for inferencing after weights have been successfully trained. The use of LUT replaces the matrix multiply and add operations with a small number of LUTs and addition operations resulting in a multiplier-less implementation. We compare the different tradeoffs of this approach in terms of accuracy versus LUT size and the number of operations. 

109__ Multi-view Information-theoretic Co-clustering for Co-occurrence Data__arXiv:1905.10594
Author: Peng Xu
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10594
 Abstract: Multi-view clustering has received much attention recently. Most of the existing multi-view clustering methods only focus on one-sided clustering. As the co-occurring data elements involve the counts of sample-feature co-occurrences, it is more efficient to conduct two-sided clustering along the samples and features simultaneously. To take advantage of two-sided clustering for the co-occurrences in the scene of multi-view clustering, a two-sided multi-view clustering method is proposed, i.e., multi-view information-theoretic co-clustering (MV-ITCC). The proposed method realizes two-sided clustering for co-occurring multi-view data under the formulation of information theory. More specifically, it exploits the agreement and disagreement among views by sharing a common clustering results along the sample dimension and keeping the clustering results of each view specific along the feature dimension. In addition, the mechanism of maximum entropy is also adopted to control the importance of different views, which can give a right balance in leveraging the agreement and disagreement. Extensive experiments are conducted on text and image multi-view datasets. The results clearly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. 

110__ Hebbian-Descent__arXiv:1905.10585
Author: Jan Melchior
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10585
 Abstract: In this work we propose Hebbian-descent as a biologically plausible learning rule for hetero-associative as well as auto-associative learning in single layer artificial neural networks. It can be used as a replacement for gradient descent as well as Hebbian learning, in particular in online learning, as it inherits their advantages while not suffering from their disadvantages. We discuss the drawbacks of Hebbian learning as having problems with correlated input data and not profiting from seeing training patterns several times. For gradient descent we identify the derivative of the activation function as problematic especially in online learning. Hebbian-descent addresses these problems by getting rid of the activation function's derivative and by centering, i.e. keeping the neural activities mean free, leading to a biologically plausible update rule that is provably convergent, does not suffer from the vanishing error term problem, can deal with correlated data, profits from seeing patterns several times, and enables successful online learning when centering is used. We discuss its relationship to Hebbian learning, contrastive learning, and gradient decent and show that in case of a strictly positive derivative of the activation function Hebbian-descent leads to the same update rule as gradient descent but for a different loss function. In this case Hebbian-descent inherits the convergence properties of gradient descent, but we also show empirically that it converges when the derivative of the activation function is only non-negative, such as for the step function for example. Furthermore, in case of the mean squared error loss Hebbian-descent can be understood as the difference between two Hebb-learning steps, which in case of an invertible and integrable activation function actually optimizes a generalized linear model. ... 

111__ Ultrametric Fitting by Gradient Descent__arXiv:1905.10566
Author: Giovanni Chierchia
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10566
 Abstract: We study the problem of fitting an ultrametric distance to a dissimilarity graph in the context of hierarchical cluster analysis. Standard hierarchical clustering methods are specified procedurally, rather than in terms of the cost function to be optimized. We aim to overcome this limitation by presenting a general optimization framework for ultrametric fitting. Our approach consists of modeling the latter as a constrained optimization problem over the continuous space of ultrametrics. So doing, we can leverage the simple, yet effective, idea of replacing the ultrametric constraint with an equivalent min-max operation injected directly into the cost function. The proposed reformulation leads to an unconstrained optimization problem that can be efficiently solved by gradient descent methods. The flexibility of our framework allows us to investigate several cost functions, following the classic paradigm of combining a data fidelity term with a regularization. While we provide no theoretical guarantee to find the global optimum, the numerical results obtained over a number of synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the good performance of our approach with respect to state-of-the-art agglomerative algorithms. This makes us believe that the proposed framework sheds new light on the way to design a new generation of hierarchical clustering methods. 

112__ The variational infomax autoencoder__arXiv:1905.10549
Author: Vincenzo Crescimanna
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10549
 Abstract: We propose the Variational InfoMax AutoEncoder (VIMAE), a method to train a generative model, maximizing the variational lower bound of the mutual information between the visible data and the hidden representation, maintaining bounded the capacity of the network. In the paper we investigate the capacity role in a neural network and deduce that a small capacity network tends to learn a more robust and disentangled representation than an high capacity one. Such observations are confirmed by the computational experiments. 

113__ Dynamic Cell Structure via Recursive-Recurrent Neural Networks__arXiv:1905.10540
Author: Xin Qian
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10540
 Abstract: In a recurrent setting, conventional approaches to neural architecture search find and fix a general model for all data samples and time steps. We propose a novel algorithm that can dynamically search for the structure of cells in a recurrent neural network model. Based on a combination of recurrent and recursive neural networks, our algorithm is able to construct customized cell structures for each data sample and time step, allowing for a more efficient architecture search than existing models. Experiments on three common datasets show that the algorithm discovers high-performance cell architectures and achieves better prediction accuracy compared to the GRU structure for language modelling and sentiment analysis. 

114__ Bivariate Beta LSTM__arXiv:1905.10521
Author: Kyungwoo Song
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10521
 Abstract: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) infers the long term dependency through a cell state maintained by the input and the forget gate structures, which models a gate output as a value in [0,1] through a sigmoid function. However, due to the graduality of the sigmoid function, the sigmoid gate is not flexible in representing multi-modality or skewness. Besides, the previous models lack correlation modeling between the gates, which would be a new method to adopt domain knowledge. This paper proposes a new gate structure with the bivariate Beta distribution. The proposed gate structure enables hierarchical probabilistic modeling on the gates within the LSTM cell, so the modelers can customize the cell state flow. Also, we observed that our structured flexible gate modeling is enabled by the probability density estimation. Moreover, we theoretically show and empirically experiment that the bivariate Beta distribution gate structure alleviates the gradient vanishing problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of bivariate Beta gate structure on the sentence classification, image classification, polyphonic music modeling, and image caption generation. 

115__ Semi-supervised Learning with Contrastive Predicative Coding__arXiv:1905.10514
Author: Jiaxing Wang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10514
 Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) provides a powerful framework for leveraging unlabeled data when labels are limited or expensive to obtain. SSL algorithms based on deep neural networks have recently proven successful on standard benchmark tasks. However, many of them have thus far been either inflexible, inefficient or non-scalable. This paper explores recently developed contrastive predictive coding technique to improve discriminative power of deep learning models when a large portion of labels are absent. Two models, cpc-SSL and a class conditional variant~(ccpc-SSL) are presented. They effectively exploit the unlabeled data by extracting shared information between different parts of the (high-dimensional) data. The proposed approaches are inductive, and scale well to very large datasets like ImageNet, making them good candidates in real-world large scale applications. 

116__ Resisting Adversarial Attacks by $k$-Winners-Take-All__arXiv:1905.10510
Author: Chang Xiao
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10510
 Abstract: We propose a simple change to the current neural network structure for defending against gradient-based adversarial attacks. Instead of using popular activation functions (such as ReLU), we advocate the use of $k$-Winners-Take-All ($k$-WTA) activation, a $C^0$ discontinuous function that purposely invalidates the neural network model's gradient at densely distributed input data points. Our proposal is theoretically rationalized. We show why the discontinuities in $k$-WTA networks can largely prevent gradient-based search of adversarial examples and why they at the same time remain innocuous to the network training. This understanding is also empirically backed. Even without notoriously expensive adversarial training, the robustness performance of our networks is comparable to conventional ReLU networks optimized by adversarial training. Furthermore, after also optimized through adversarial training, our networks outperform the state-of-the-art methods under white-box attacks on various datasets that we experimented with. 

117__ A Kernel Loss for Solving the Bellman Equation__arXiv:1905.10506
Author: Yihao Feng
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10506
 Abstract: Value function learning plays a central role in many state-of-the-art reinforcement-learning algorithms. Many popular algorithms like Q-learning do not optimize any objective function, but are fixed-point iterations of some variant of Bellman operator that is not necessarily a contraction. As a result, they may easily lose convergence guarantees, as can be observed in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function, which can be optimized using standard gradient-based methods without risking divergence. The key advantage is that its gradient can be easily approximated using sampled transitions, avoiding the need for double samples required by prior algorithms like residual gradient. Our approach may be combined with general function classes such as neural networks, on either on- or off-policy data, and is shown to work reliably and effectively in several benchmarks. 

118__ Learning to Reason in Large Theories without Imitation__arXiv:1905.10501
Author: Kshitij Bansal
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10501
 Abstract: Automated theorem proving in large theories can be learned via reinforcement learning over an indefinitely growing action space. In order to select actions, one performs nearest neighbor lookups in the knowledge base to find premises to be applied. Here we address the exploration for reinforcement learning in this space. Approaches (like epsilon-greedy strategy) that sample actions uniformly do not scale to this scenario as most actions lead to dead ends and unsuccessful proofs which are not useful for training our models. In this paper, we compare approaches that select premises using randomly initialized similarity measures and mixing them with the proposals of the learned model. We evaluate these on the HOList benchmark for tactics based higher order theorem proving. We implement an automated theorem prover named DeepHOL-Zero that does not use any of the human proofs and show that our improved exploration method manages to expand the training set continuously. DeepHOL-Zero outperforms the best theorem prover trained by imitation learning alone. 

119__ The Lost MNIST Digits__arXiv:1905.10498
Author: Chhavi Yadav
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10498
 Abstract: Although the popular MNIST dataset [LeCun et al., 1994] is derived from the NIST database [Grother and Hanaoka, 1995], the precise processing steps for this derivation have been lost to time. We propose a reconstruction that is accurate enough to serve as a replacement for the MNIST dataset, with insignificant changes in accuracy. We trace each MNIST digit to its NIST source and its rich metadata such as writer identifier, partition identifier, etc. We also reconstruct the complete MNIST test set with 60,000 samples instead of the usual 10,000. Since the balance 50,000 were never distributed, they enable us to investigate the impact of twenty-five years of MNIST experiments on the reported testing performances. Our results unambiguously confirm the trends observed by Recht et al. [2018, 2019]: although the misclassification rates are slightly off, classifier ordering and model selection remain broadly reliable. We attribute this phenomenon to the pairing benefits of comparing classifiers on the same digits.

 Abstract: Federated learning involves training statistical models in massive, heterogeneous networks. Naively minimizing an aggregate loss function in such a network may disproportionately advantage or disadvantage some of the devices. In this work, we propose q-Fair Federated Learning (q-FFL), a novel optimization objective inspired by resource allocation in wireless networks that encourages a more fair (i.e., lower-variance) accuracy distribution across devices in federated networks. To solve q-FFL, we devise a communication-efficient method, q-FedAvg, that is suited to federated networks. We validate both the effectiveness of q-FFL and the efficiency of q-FedAvg on a suite of federated datasets, and show that q-FFL (along with q-FedAvg) outperforms existing baselines in terms of the resulting fairness, flexibility, and efficiency. 

121__ Sparse Gaussian Process Modulated Hawkes Process__arXiv:1905.10496
Author: Rui Zhang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10496
 Abstract: The Hawkes process has been widely applied to modeling self-exciting events, including neuron spikes, earthquakes and tweets. To avoid designing parametric kernel functions and to be able to quantify the prediction confidence, non-parametric Bayesian Hawkes processes have been proposed. However the inference of such models suffers from unscalability or slow convergence. In this paper, we first propose a new non-parametric Bayesian Hawkes process whose triggering kernel is modeled as a squared sparse Gaussian process. Second, we present the variational inference scheme for the model optimization, which has the advantage of linear time complexity by leveraging the stationarity of the triggering kernel. Third, we contribute a tighter lower bound than the evidence lower bound of the marginal likelihood for the model selection. Finally, we exploit synthetic data and large-scale social media data to validate the efficiency of our method and the practical utility of our approximate marginal likelihood. We show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art non-parametric Bayesian and non-Bayesian methods. 

122__ Robust learning with implicit residual networks__arXiv:1905.10479
Author: Viktor Reshniak
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10479
 Abstract: In this effort we propose a new deep architecture utilizing residual blocks inspired by implicit discretization schemes. As opposed to the standard feed-forward networks, the outputs of the proposed implicit residual blocks are defined as the fixed points of the appropriately chosen nonlinear transformations. We show that this choice leads to improved stability of both forward and backward propagations, has a favorable impact on the generalization power of the network and allows for higher learning rates. In addition, we consider a reformulation of ResNet which does not introduce new parameters and can potentially lead to a reduction in the number of required layers due to improved forward stability and robustness. Finally, we derive the memory efficient reversible training algorithm and provide numerical results in support of our findings. 

123__ Bayesian Tensorized Neural Networks with Automatic Rank Selection__arXiv:1905.10478
Author: Cole Hawkins
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10478
 Abstract: Tensor decomposition is an effective approach to compress over-parameterized neural networks and to enable their deployment on resource-constrained hardware platforms. However, directly applying tensor compression in the training process is a challenging task due to the difficulty of choosing a proper tensor rank. In order to achieve this goal, this paper proposes a Bayesian tensorized neural network. Our Bayesian method performs automatic model compression via an adaptive tensor rank determination. We also present approaches for posterior density calculation and maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation for the end-to-end training of our tensorized neural network. We provide experimental validation on a fully connected neural network, a CNN and a residual neural network where our work produces $7.4\times$ to $137\times$ more compact neural networks directly from the training. 

124__ A view of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms through the lens of  Expectation-Maximization__arXiv:1905.10474
Author: David H. Brookes
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10474
 Abstract: We show that under mild conditions, Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) can be written as variational Expectation-Maximization (EM) that uses a mixture of weighted particles as the approximate posterior. In the infinite particle limit, EDAs can be viewed as exact EM. Because EM sits on a rigorous statistical foundation and has been thoroughly analyzed, this connection provides a coherent framework with which to reason about EDAs. Importantly, the connection also suggests avenues for possible improvements to EDAs owing to our ability to leverage both general, and EM-specific statistical tools and generalizations. For example, we make use of results about known EM convergence properties to propose an adaptive, hybrid EDA-gradient descent algorithm; this hybrid demonstrates better performance than either component of the hybrid on several canonical, non-convex test functions. We also demonstrate empirically that although one might hypothesize that reducing the variational gap could prove useful, it actually degrades performance of EDAs. Finally, we show that the equivalence between EM and EDAs provides us with a new perspective on why EDAs are performing approximate natural gradient descent. 

125__ A Polynomial-Based Approach for Architectural Design and Learning with  Deep Neural Networks__arXiv:1905.10457
Author: Joseph Daws Jr.
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10457
 Abstract: In this effort we propose a novel approach for reconstructing multivariate functions from training data, by identifying both a suitable network architecture and an initialization using polynomial-based approximations. Training deep neural networks using gradient descent can be interpreted as moving the set of network parameters along the loss landscape in order to minimize the loss functional. The initialization of parameters is important for iterative training methods based on descent. Our procedure produces a network whose initial state is a polynomial representation of the training data. The major advantage of this technique is from this initialized state the network may be improved using standard training procedures. Since the network already approximates the data, training is more likely to produce a set of parameters associated with a desirable local minimum. We provide the details of the theory necessary for constructing such networks and also consider several numerical examples that reveal our approach ultimately produces networks which can be effectively trained from our initialized state to achieve an improved approximation for a large class of target functions. 

126__ Additive Noise Annealing and Approximation Properties of Quantized  Neural Networks__arXiv:1905.10452
Author: Matteo Spallanzani
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10452
 Abstract: We present a theoretical and experimental investigation of the quantization problem for artificial neural networks. We provide a mathematical definition of quantized neural networks and analyze their approximation capabilities, showing in particular that any Lipschitz-continuous map defined on a hypercube can be uniformly approximated by a quantized neural network. We then focus on the regularization effect of additive noise on the arguments of multi-step functions inherent to the quantization of continuous variables. In particular, when the expectation operator is applied to a non-differentiable multi-step random function, and if the underlying probability density is differentiable (in either classical or weak sense), then a differentiable function is retrieved, with explicit bounds on its Lipschitz constant. Based on these results, we propose a novel gradient-based training algorithm for quantized neural networks that generalizes the straight-through estimator, acting on noise applied to the network's parameters. We evaluate our algorithm on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet image classification benchmarks, showing state-of-the-art performance on AlexNet and MobileNetV2 for ternary networks. 

127__ Latent Backdoor Attacks on Deep Neural Networks__arXiv:1905.10447
Author: Yuanshun Yao
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10447
 Abstract: Recent work has proposed the concept of backdoor attacks on deep neural networks (DNNs), where misbehaviors are hidden inside "normal" models, only to be triggered by very specific inputs. In practice, however, these attacks are difficult to perform and highly constrained by sharing of models through transfer learning. Adversaries have a small window during which they must compromise the student model before it is deployed. In this paper, we describe a significantly more powerful variant of the backdoor attack, latent backdoors, where hidden rules can be embedded in a single "Teacher" model, and automatically inherited by all "Student" models through the transfer learning process. We show that latent backdoors can be quite effective in a variety of application contexts, and validate its practicality through real-world attacks against traffic sign recognition, iris identification of lab volunteers, and facial recognition of public figures (politicians). Finally, we evaluate 4 potential defenses, and find that only one is effective in disrupting latent backdoors, but might incur a cost in classification accuracy as tradeoff. 

128__ Neural basis expansion analysis for interpretable time series  forecasting__arXiv:1905.10437
Author: Boris N. Oreshkin
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10437
 Abstract: We focus on solving the univariate times series point forecasting problem using deep learning. We propose a deep neural architecture based on backward and forward residual links and a very deep stack of fully-connected layers. The architecture has a number of desirable properties, being interpretable, applicable without modification to a wide array of target domains, and fast to train. We test the proposed architecture on the well-known M4 competition dataset containing 100k time series from diverse domains. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for two configurations of N-BEATS, improving forecast accuracy by 11% over a statistical benchmark and by 3% over last year's winner of the M4 competition, a domain-adjusted hand-crafted hybrid between neural network and statistical time series models. The first configuration of our model does not employ any time-series-specific components and its performance on the M4 dataset strongly suggests that, contrarily to received wisdom, deep learning primitives such as residual blocks are by themselves sufficient to solve a wide range of forecasting problems. Finally, we demonstrate how the proposed architecture can be augmented to provide outputs that are interpretable without loss in accuracy. 

129__ Logarithm-depth Streaming Multi-label Decision Trees__arXiv:1905.10428
Author: Maryam Majzoubi
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10428
 Abstract: We consider multi-label classification where the goal is to annotate each data point with the most relevant $\textit{subset}$ of labels from an extremely large label set. Efficient annotation can be achieved with balanced tree predictors, i.e. trees with logarithmic-depth in the label complexity, whose leaves correspond to labels. Designing prediction mechanism with such trees for real data applications is non-trivial as it needs to accommodate sending examples to multiple leaves while at the same time sustain high prediction accuracy. In this paper we develop the LdSM algorithm for the construction and training of multi-label decision trees, where in every node of the tree we optimize a novel objective function that favors balanced splits, maintains high class purity of children nodes, and allows sending examples to multiple directions but with a penalty that prevents tree over-growth. Each node of the tree is trained once the previous one is completed leading to a streaming approach for training. We analyze the proposed method theoretically and show that minimizing the objective leads to pure and balanced data splits. Furthermore, we prove that optimizing it results in the monotonic decrease of the error with every split. Experimental results on benchmark data sets demonstrate that our approach achieves high prediction accuracy with logarithmic-depth trees and position LdSM as a competitive tool among existing state-of-the-art tree-based approaches in terms of the statistical performance and prediction time. 

130__ Differentiable Representations For Multihop Inference Rules__arXiv:1905.10417
Author: William W. Cohen
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10417
 Abstract: We present efficient differentiable implementations of second-order multi-hop reasoning using a large symbolic knowledge base (KB). We introduce a new operation which can be used to compositionally construct second-order multi-hop templates in a neural model, and evaluate a number of alternative implementations, with different time and memory trade offs. These techniques scale to KBs with millions of entities and tens of millions of triples, and lead to simple models with competitive performance on several learning tasks requiring multi-hop reasoning. 

131__ A New Approach for Constructing and Training  Neural Networks__arXiv:1905.10409
Author: Anton Dereventsov
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10409
 Abstract: We present a novel greedy approach to obtain a single layer neural network approximation to a target function with the use of a ReLU activation function. In our approach we construct a shallow network by utilizing a greedy algorithm where the set of possible inner weights acts as a parametrization of the prescribed dictionary. To facilitate the greedy selection we employ an integral representation of the network, based on the ridgelet transform, that significantly reduces the cardinality of the dictionary and hence promotes feasibility of the proposed method. Our approach allows for the construction of efficient architectures which can be treated either as improved initializations to be used in place of random-based alternatives, or as fully-trained networks, thus potentially nullifying the need for training and/or calibrating based on backpropagation. Numerical experiments demonstrate the tenability of the proposed concept and its advantages compared to the classical techniques for training and constructing neural networks. 

132__ Interpretable Reinforcement Learning using Information  Maximization__arXiv:1905.10404
Author: Aadil Hayat
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10404
 Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning have proved that given an environment we can learn to perform a task in that environment if we have access to some form of a reward function (dense, sparse or derived from IRL). But most of the algorithms focus on learning a single best policy to perform a given set of tasks. In this paper, we focus on an algorithm that learns to not just perform a task but different ways to perform the same task. As we know when the environment is complex enough there always exists multiple ways to perform a task. We show that using the concept of information maximization it is possible to learn latent codes for discovering multiple ways to perform any given task in an environment. 

133__ Neural Jump Stochastic Differential Equations__arXiv:1905.10403
Author: Junteng Jia
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10403
 Abstract: Many time series can be effectively modeled with a combination of continuous flows along with random jumps sparked by discrete events. However, we usually do not have the equation of motion describing the flows, or how they are affected by jumps. To this end, we introduce Neural Jump Stochastic Differential Equations that provide a data-driven approach to learn continuous and discrete dynamic behavior, i.e., hybrid systems that both flow and jump. Our approach extends the framework of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations with a stochastic process term that models discrete events. We then model temporal point processes with a piecewise-continuous latent trajectory, where stochastic events cause an abrupt change in the latent variables. We demonstrate the predictive capabilities of our model on a range of synthetic and real-world marked point process datasets, including classical point processes such as Hawkes processes, medical records, awards on Stack Overflow, and earthquake monitoring. 

134__ Leader Stochastic Gradient Descent for Distributed Training of Deep  Learning Models__arXiv:1905.10395
Author: Yunfei Teng
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10395
 Abstract: We consider distributed optimization under communication constraints for training deep learning models. We propose a new algorithm, whose parameter updates rely on two forces: a regular gradient step, and a corrective direction dictated by the currently best-performing worker (leader). Our method differs from the parameter-averaging scheme EASGD in a number of ways: (i) our objective formulation does not change the location of stationary points compared to the original optimization problem; (ii) we avoid convergence decelerations caused by pulling local workers descending to different local minima to each other (i.e. to the average of their parameters); (iii) our update by design breaks the curse of symmetry (the phenomenon of being trapped in poorly generalizing sub-optimal solutions in symmetric non-convex landscapes); and (iv) our approach is more communication efficient since it broadcasts only parameters of the leader rather than all workers. We provide theoretical analysis of the batch version of the proposed algorithm, which we call Leader Gradient Descent (LGD), and its stochastic variant (LSGD). Finally, we implement an asynchronous version of our algorithm and extend it to the multi-leader setting, where we form groups of workers, each represented by its own local leader (the best performer in a group), and update each worker with a corrective direction comprised of two attractive forces: one to the local, and one to the global leader (the best performer among all workers). The multi-leader setting is well-aligned with current hardware architecture, where local workers forming a group lie within a single computational node and different groups correspond to different nodes. For training convolutional neural networks, we empirically demonstrate that our approach compares favorably to state-of-the-art baselines. 

135__ Matrix Bandit, Kernels, and  Regret Bound__arXiv:1905.10389
Author: Lin F. Yang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10389
 Abstract: Exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from the curse of dimensionality when the state-action space is large. A common practice is to parameterize the high-dimensional value and policy functions using given features. However existing methods either have no theoretical guarantee or suffer a regret that is exponential in the planning horizon $H$. In this paper, we propose an online RL algorithm, namely the MatrixRL, that leverages ideas from linear bandit to learn a low-dimensional representation of the probability transition model while carefully balancing the exploitation-exploration tradeoff. We show that MatrixRL achieves a regret bound ${O}\big(H^2d\log T\sqrt{T}\big)$ where $d$ is the number of features. MatrixRL has an equivalent kernelized version, which is able to work with an arbitrary kernel Hilbert space without using explicit features. In this case, the kernelized MatrixRL satisfies a regret bound ${O}\big(H^2\widetilde{d}\log T\sqrt{T}\big)$, where $\widetilde{d}$ is the effective dimension of the kernel space. To our best knowledge, for RL using features or kernels, our results are the first regret bounds that are near-optimal in time $T$ and dimension $d$ (or $\widetilde{d}$) and polynomial in the planning horizon $H$. 

136__ Should I Include this Edge in my Prediction? Analyzing the  Stability-Performance Tradeoff__arXiv:1905.11374
Author: Adarsh Subbaswamy
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11374
 Abstract: Recent work addressing model reliability and generalization has resulted in a variety of methods that seek to proactively address differences between the training and unknown target environments. While most methods achieve this by finding distributions that will be invariant across environments, we will show they do not necessarily find the same distributions which has implications for performance. In this paper we unify existing work on prediction using stable distributions by relating environmental shifts to edges in the graph underlying a prediction problem, and characterize stable distributions as those which effectively remove these edges. We then quantify the effect of edge deletion on performance in the linear case and corroborate the findings in a simulated and real data experiment. 

137__ Revisiting Stochastic Extragradient__arXiv:1905.11373
Author: Konstantin Mishchenko
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11373
 Abstract: We consider a new extension of the extragradient method that is motivated by approximating implicit updates. Since in a recent work~\cite{chavdarova2019reducing} it was shown that the existing stochastic extragradient algorithm (called mirror-prox) of~\cite{juditsky2011solving} diverges on a simple bilinear problem, we prove guarantees for solving variational inequality that are more general than in~\cite{juditsky2011solving}. Furthermore, we illustrate numerically that the proposed variant converges faster than many other methods on the example of~\cite{chavdarova2019reducing}. We also discuss how extragradient can be applied to training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Our experiments on GANs demonstrate that the introduced approach may make the training faster in terms of data passes, while its higher iteration complexity makes the advantage smaller. To further accelerate method's convergence on problems such as bilinear minimax, we combine the extragradient step with negative momentum~\cite{gidel2018negative} and discuss the optimal momentum value. error here, check on website.

139__ Large-Scale Statistical Survey of Magnetopause Reconnection__arXiv:1905.11359
Author: Samantha Piatt
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11359
 Abstract: The Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission (MMS) seeks to study the micro-physics of reconnection, which occurs at the magnetopause boundary layer between the magnetosphere of Earth and the interplanetary magnetic field originating from the sun. Identifying this region of space automatically will allow for statistical analysis of reconnection events. The magnetopause region is difficult to identify automatically using simple models, and time consuming for scientists to classify by hand. We introduced a hierarchical Bayesian mixture model with linear and auto regressive components to identify the magnetopause. Using data from the MMS mission with the programming languages R and Stan, we modeled and predicted possible regions and evaluated our performance against a boosted regression tree model. Our model selects twice as many magnetopause regions as the comparison model, without significant over selection, achieving a 31\% true positive rate and 93\% true negative rate. Our method will allow scientists to study the micro-physics of reconnection events in the magnetopause using the large body of MMS data without manual classification. 

140__ Real-time Instance Segmentation Made More Accurate__arXiv:1905.11358
Author: Laurynas Miksys
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11358
 Abstract: Instance segmentation is an important problem in computer vision, with applications in autonomous driving, drone navigation and robotic manipulation. However, most existing methods are not real-time, complicating their deployment in time-sensitive contexts. In this work, we extend an existing approach to real-time instance segmentation, called `Straight to Shapes' (STS), which makes use of low-dimensional shape embedding spaces to directly regress to object shape masks. The STS model can run at 35 FPS on a high-end desktop, but its accuracy is significantly worse than that of offline state-of-the-art methods. We leverage recent advances in the design and training of deep instance segmentation models to improve the performance accuracy of the STS model whilst keeping its real-time capabilities intact. In particular, we find that parameter sharing, more aggressive data augmentation and the use of structured loss for shape mask prediction all provide a useful boost to the network performance. Our proposed approach, `Straight to Shapes++', achieves a remarkable 19.7 point improvement in mAP (at IOU of 0.5) over the original method as evaluated on the PASCAL VOC dataset, thus redefining the accuracy frontier at real-time speeds. Since the accuracy of instance segmentation is closely tied to that of object bounding box prediction, we also study the error profile of the latter and examine the failure modes of our method for future improvements. 

141__ Multilevel Knowledge-Guided Attention for Modeling  Electrocardiography Signals__arXiv:1905.11333
Author: Shenda Hong
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11333
 Abstract: Electrocardiography (ECG) signals are commonly used to diagnose various cardiac abnormalities. Recently, deep learning models showed initial success on modeling ECG data, however they are mostly black-box, thus lack interpretability needed for clinical usage. In this work, we propose MultIlevel kNowledge-guided Attention networks (MINA) that predict heart diseases from ECG signals with intuitive explanation aligned with medical knowledge. By extracting multilevel (beat-, rhythm- and frequency-level) domain knowledge features separately, MINA combines the medical knowledge and ECG data via a multilevel attention model, making the learned models highly interpretable. Our experiments showed MINA achieved PR-AUC 0.9436 (outperforming the best baseline by 5.51%) in real world ECG dataset. Finally, MINA also demonstrated robust performance and strong interpretability against signal distortion and noise contamination.

PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11313
 Abstract: The probability density function for the visible sector of a Riemann-Theta Boltzmann machine can be taken conditional on a subset of the visible units. We derive that the corresponding conditional density function is given by a reparameterization of the Riemann-Theta Boltzmann machine modelling the original probability density function. Therefore the conditional densities can be directly inferred from the Riemann-Theta Boltzmann machine. 

143__ UAV Vision Guided Aerial-Ground Air Quality Sensing  System__arXiv:1905.11299
Author: Yuzhe Yang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11299
 Abstract: Given the increasingly serious air pollution problem, the monitoring of air quality index (AQI) in urban areas has drawn considerable attention. This paper presents ImgSensingNet, a vision guided aerial-ground sensing system, for fine-grained air quality monitoring and forecasting using the fusion of haze images taken by the unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV) and the AQI data collected by an on-ground three-dimensional (3D) wireless sensor network (WSN). Specifically, ImgSensingNet first leverages the computer vision technique to tell the AQI scale in different regions from the taken haze images, where haze-relevant features and a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) are designed for direct learning between haze images and corresponding AQI scale. Based on the learnt AQI scale, ImgSensingNet determines whether to wake up on-ground wireless sensors for small-scale AQI monitoring and inference, which can greatly reduce the energy consumption of the system. An entropy-based model is employed for accurate real-time AQI inference at unmeasured locations and future air quality distribution forecasting. We implement and evaluate ImgSensingNet on two university campuses since Feb. 2018, and has collected 17,630 photos and 2.6 millions of AQI data samples. Experimental results confirm that ImgSensingNet can achieve higher inference accuracy while greatly reduce the energy consumption, compared to state-of-the-art AQI monitoring approaches. 

144__ Combating Adversarial Misspellings with Robust Word Recognition__arXiv:1905.11268
Author: Danish Pruthi
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11268
 Abstract: To combat adversarial spelling mistakes, we propose placing a word recognition model in front of the downstream classifier. Our word recognition models build upon the RNN semi-character architecture, introducing several new backoff strategies for handling rare and unseen words. Trained to recognize words corrupted by random adds, drops, swaps, and keyboard mistakes, our method achieves 32% relative (and 3.3% absolute) error reduction over the vanilla semi-character model. Notably, our pipeline confers robustness on the downstream classifier, outperforming both adversarial training and off-the-shelf spell checkers. Against a BERT model fine-tuned for sentiment analysis, a single adversarially-chosen character attack lowers accuracy from 90.3% to 45.8%. Our defense restores accuracy to 75%. Surprisingly, better word recognition does not always entail greater robustness. Our analysis reveals that robustness also depends upon a quantity that we denote the sensitivity. 

145__ Variance Reduction for Data, Parameters and  Many New Methods__arXiv:1905.11266
Author: Filip Hanzely
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11266
 Abstract: We propose a remarkably general variance-reduced method suitable for solving regularized empirical risk minimization problems with either a large number of training examples, or a large model dimension, or both. In special cases, our method reduces to several known and previously thought to be unrelated methods, such as {\tt SAGA}, {\tt LSVRG}, {\tt JacSketch}, {\tt SEGA} and {\tt ISEGA}, and their arbitrary sampling and proximal generalizations. However, we also highlight a large number of new specific algorithms with interesting properties. We provide a single theorem establishing linear convergence of the method under smoothness and quasi strong convexity assumptions. With this theorem we recover best-known and sometimes improved rates for known methods arising in special cases. As a by-product, we provide the first unified method and theory for stochastic gradient and stochastic coordinate descent type methods. 

146__ Variance Reduction, Sampling, Quantization and  Coordinate Descent__arXiv:1905.11261
Author: Eduard Gorbunov
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11261
 Abstract: In this paper we introduce a unified analysis of a large family of variants of proximal stochastic gradient descent ({\tt SGD}) which so far have required different intuitions, convergence analyses, have different applications, and which have been developed separately in various communities. We show that our framework includes methods with and without the following tricks, and their combinations: variance reduction, importance sampling, mini-batch sampling, quantization, and coordinate sub-sampling. As a by-product, we obtain the first unified theory of {\tt SGD} and randomized coordinate descent ({\tt RCD}) methods, the first unified theory of variance reduced and non-variance-reduced {\tt SGD} methods, and the first unified theory of quantized and non-quantized methods. A key to our approach is a parametric assumption on the iterates and stochastic gradients. In a single theorem we establish a linear convergence result under this assumption and strong-quasi convexity of the loss function. Whenever we recover an existing method as a special case, our theorem gives the best known complexity result. Our approach can be used to motivate the development of new useful methods, and offers pre-proved convergence guarantees. To illustrate the strength of our approach, we develop five new variants of {\tt SGD}, and through numerical experiments demonstrate some of their properties. 

147__ Towards Universal Dialogue Management with Structured Deep  Reinforcement Learning__arXiv:1905.11259
Author: Lu Chen
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11259
 Abstract: Dialogue policy plays an important role in task-oriented spoken dialogue systems. It determines how to respond to users. The recently proposed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches have been used for policy optimization. However, these deep models are still challenging for two reasons: 1) Many DRL-based policies are not sample-efficient. 2) Most models don't have the capability of policy transfer between different domains. In this paper, we propose a universal framework, AgentGraph, to tackle these two problems. The proposed AgentGraph is the combination of GNN-based architecture and DRL-based algorithm. It can be regarded as one of the multi-agent reinforcement learning approaches. Each agent corresponds to a node in a graph, which is defined according to the dialogue domain ontology. When making a decision, each agent can communicate with its neighbors on the graph. Under AgentGraph framework, we further propose Dual GNN-based dialogue policy, which implicitly decomposes the decision in each turn into a high-level global decision and a low-level local decision. Experiments show that AgentGraph models significantly outperform traditional reinforcement learning approaches on most of the 18 tasks of the PyDial benchmark. Moreover, when transferred from the source task to a target task, these models not only have acceptable initial performance but also converge much faster on the target task. 

148__ Walsh-Hadamard Variational Inference for Bayesian Deep Learning__arXiv:1905.11248
Author: Simone Rossi
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11248
 Abstract: Over-parameterized models, such as DeepNets and ConvNets, form a class of models that are routinely adopted in a wide variety of applications, and for which Bayesian inference is desirable but extremely challenging. Variational inference offers the tools to tackle this challenge in a scalable way and with some degree of flexibility on the approximation, but for over-parameterized models this is challenging due to the over-regularization property of the variational objective. Inspired by the literature on kernel methods, and in particular on structured approximations of distributions of random matrices, this paper proposes Walsh-Hadamard Variational Inference (WHVI), which uses Walsh-Hadamard-based factorization strategies to reduce the parameterization and accelerate computations, thus avoiding over-regularization issues with the variational objective. Extensive theoretical and empirical analyses demonstrate that WHVI yields considerable speedups and model reductions compared to other techniques to carry out approximate inference for over-parameterized models, and ultimately show how advances in kernel methods can be translated into advances in approximate Bayesian inference. 

149__ Continuous Integrate-and-Fire for End-to-End Speech Recognition__arXiv:1905.11235
Author: Linhao Dong
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11235
 Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) system is undergoing an exciting pathway to be more simplified and practical with the spring up of various end-to-end models. However, the mainstream of them neglects the positioning of token boundaries from continuous speech, which is considered crucial in human language learning and instant speech recognition. In this work, we propose Continuous Integrate-and-Fire (CIF), a 'soft' and 'monotonic' acoustic-to-linguistic alignment mechanism that addresses the boundary positioning by simulating the integrate-and-fire neuron model using continuous functions under the encoder-decoder framework. As the connection between the encoder and decoder, the CIF forwardly integrates the information in the encoded acoustic representations to determine a boundary and instantly fires the integrated information to the decoder once a boundary is located. Multiple effective strategies are introduced to the CIF-based model to alleviate the problems brought by the inaccurate positioning. Besides, multi-task learning is performed during training and an external language model is incorporated during inference to further boost the model performance. Evaluated on multiple ASR datasets that cover different languages and speech types, the CIF-based model shows stable convergence and competitive performance. Especially, it achieves a word error rate (WER) of 3.70% on the test-clean of Librispeech.

PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11222
 Abstract: The option-critic paper and several variants have successfully demonstrated the use of the options framework proposed by Barto et al to scale learning and planning in hierarchical tasks. Although most of these frameworks use entropy as a regularizer to improve exploration, they do not maximize entropy along with returns at every time step. In this paper we investigate the effect of maximizing entropy of each options and inter-option policy in options framework. We adopt the architecture of the recently introduced soft-actor critic algorithm to enable learning of robust options in continuous and discrete action spaces in a off-policy manner thus also making it sample efficient. In this paper we derive the soft options improvement theorem and propose a novel soft-options framework to incorporate maximization of entropy of actions and options in a constrained manner. Our experiments show that maximizing entropy of actions and options in a constrained manner with high learning rate does not harm the main objective of maximizing returns and hence outperforms vanilla options-critic framework in most hierarchical tasks. We also observe faster recovery when the environment is subject to perturbations. 

151__ Automated Ground Truth Estimation of Vulnerable Road Users in Automotive  Radar Data Using GNSS__arXiv:1905.11219
Author: Nicolas Scheiner
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11219
 Abstract: Annotating automotive radar data is a difficult task. This article presents an automated way of acquiring data labels which uses a highly accurate and portable global navigation satellite system (GNSS). The proposed system is discussed besides a revision of other label acquisitions techniques and a problem description of manual data annotation. The article concludes with a systematic comparison of conventional hand labeling and automatic data acquisition. The results show clear advantages of the proposed method without a relevant loss in labeling accuracy. Minor changes can be observed in the measured radar data, but the so introduced bias of the GNSS reference is clearly outweighed by the indisputable time savings. Beside data annotation, the proposed system can also provide a ground truth for validating object tracking or other automated driving system applications. 

152__ Joint Unsupervised Learning of Objects and  Physics from Video__arXiv:1905.11169
Author: Miguel Jaques
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11169
 Abstract: We aim to perform unsupervised discovery of objects and their states such as location and velocity, as well as physical system parameters such as mass and gravity from video -- given only the differential equations governing the scene dynamics. Existing physical scene understanding methods require either object state supervision, or do not integrate with differentiable physics to learn interpretable system parameters and states. We address this problem through a $\textit{physics-as-inverse-graphics}$ approach that brings together vision-as-inverse-graphics and differentiable physics engines. This framework allows us to perform long term extrapolative video prediction, as well as vision-based model-predictive control. Our approach significantly outperforms related unsupervised methods in long-term future frame prediction of systems with interacting objects (such as ball-spring or 3-body gravitational systems). We further show the value of this tight vision-physics integration by demonstrating data-efficient learning of vision-actuated model-based control for a pendulum system. The controller's interpretability also provides unique capabilities in goal-driven control and physical reasoning for zero-data adaptation. 

153__ Colonel Blotto Games and Hide-and-Seek Games as Path Planning Problems  with Side Observations__arXiv:1905.11151
Author: Dong Quan Vu
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11151
 Abstract: Resource allocation games such as the famous Colonel Blotto (CB) and Hide-and-Seek (HS) games are often used to model a large variety of practical problems, but only in their one-shot versions. Indeed, due to their extremely large strategy space, it remains an open question how one can efficiently learn in these games. In this work, we show that the online CB and HS games can be cast as path planning problems with side-observations (SOPPP): at each stage, a learner chooses a path on a directed acyclic graph and suffers the sum of losses that are adversarially assigned to the corresponding edges; and she then receives semi-bandit feedback with side-observations (i.e., she observes the losses on the chosen edges plus some others). Then, we propose a novel algorithm, EXP3-OE, the first-of-its-kind with guaranteed efficient running time for SOPPP without requiring any auxiliary oracle. We provide an expected-regret bound of EXP3-OE in SOPPP matching the order of the best benchmark in the literature. Moreover, we introduce additional assumptions on the observability model under which we can further improve the regret bounds of EXP3-OE. We illustrate the benefit of using EXP3-OE in SOPPP by applying it to the online CB and HS games. 

154__ Private Learning and Regularized Optimal Transport__arXiv:1905.11148
Author: Etienne Boursier
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11148
 Abstract: Private data are valuable either by remaining private (for instance if they are sensitive) or, on the other hand, by being used publicly to increase some utility. These two objectives are antagonistic and leaking data might be more rewarding than concealing them. Unlike classical concepts of privacy that focus on the first point, we consider instead agents that optimize a natural trade-off between both objectives. We formalize this as an optimization problem where the objective mapping is regularized by the amount of information leaked by the agent into the system (measured as a divergence between the prior and posterior on the private data). Quite surprisingly, when combined with the entropic regularization, the Sinkhorn divergence naturally emerges in the optimization objective, making it efficiently solvable. We apply these techniques to preserve some privacy in online repeated auctions. 

155__ Intrinsic Multi-scale Evaluation of Generative Models__arXiv:1905.11141
Author: Anton Tsitsulin
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11141
 Abstract: Generative models are often used to sample high-dimensional data points from a manifold with small intrinsic dimension. Existing techniques for comparing generative models focus on global data properties such as mean and covariance; in that sense, they are extrinsic and uni-scale. We develop the first, to our knowledge, intrinsic and multi-scale method for characterizing and comparing underlying data manifolds, based on comparing all data moments by lower-bounding the spectral notion of the Gromov-Wasserstein distance between manifolds. In a thorough experimental study, we demonstrate that our method effectively evaluates the quality of generative models; further, we showcase its efficacy in discerning the disentanglement process in neural networks. 

156__ A collaborative filtering model with heterogeneous neural networks for  recommender systems__arXiv:1905.11133
Author: Ge Fan
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11133
 Abstract: In recent years, deep neural network is introduced in recommender systems to solve the collaborative filtering problem, which has achieved immense success on computer vision, speech recognition and natural language processing. On one hand, deep neural network can be used to model the auxiliary information in recommender systems. On the other hand, it is also capable of modeling nonlinear relationships between users and items. One advantage of deep neural network is that the performance of the algorithm can be easily enhanced by augmenting the depth of the neural network. However, two potential problems may emerge when the deep neural work is exploited to model relationships between users and items. The fundamental problem is that the complexity of the algorithm grows significantly with the increment in the depth of the neural network. The second one is that a deeper neural network may undermine the accuracy of the algorithm. In order to alleviate these problems, we propose a hybrid neural network that combines heterogeneous neural networks with different structures. The experimental results on real datasets reveal that our method is superior to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of the item ranking. 

157__ Practical and Consistent Estimation of f-Divergences__arXiv:1905.11112
Author: Paul K. Rubenstein
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11112
 Abstract: The estimation of an f-divergence between two probability distributions based on samples is a fundamental problem in statistics and machine learning. Most works study this problem under very weak assumptions, in which case it is provably hard. We consider the case of stronger structural assumptions that are commonly satisfied in modern machine learning, including representation learning and generative modelling with autoencoder architectures. Under these assumptions we propose and study an estimator that can be easily implemented, works well in high dimensions, and enjoys faster rates of convergence. We verify the behavior of our estimator empirically in both synthetic and real-data experiments, and discuss its direct implications for total correlation, entropy, and mutual information estimation. 

158__ An Empirical  Analysis of Type I, Type II and Type III Errors__arXiv:1905.11096
Author: Julin Urbano
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11096
 Abstract: Statistical significance testing is widely accepted as a means to assess how well a difference in effectiveness reflects an actual difference between systems, as opposed to random noise because of the selection of topics. According to recent surveys on SIGIR, CIKM, ECIR and TOIS papers, the t-test is the most popular choice among IR researchers. However, previous work has suggested computer intensive tests like the bootstrap or the permutation test, based mainly on theoretical arguments. On empirical grounds, others have suggested non-parametric alternatives such as the Wilcoxon test. Indeed, the question of which tests we should use has accompanied IR and related fields for decades now. Previous theoretical studies on this matter were limited in that we know that test assumptions are not met in IR experiments, and empirical studies were limited in that we do not have the necessary control over the null hypotheses to compute actual Type I and Type II error rates under realistic conditions. Therefore, not only is it unclear which test to use, but also how much trust we should put in them. In contrast to past studies, in this paper we employ a recent simulation methodology from TREC data to go around these limitations. Our study comprises over 500 million p-values computed for a range of tests, systems, effectiveness measures, topic set sizes and effect sizes, and for both the 2-tail and 1-tail cases. Having such a large supply of IR evaluation data with full knowledge of the null hypotheses, we are finally in a position to evaluate how well statistical significance tests really behave with IR data, and make sound recommendations for practitioners. 

159__ Machine Learning for Fluid Mechanics__arXiv:1905.11075
Author: Steven Brunton
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11075
 Abstract: The field of fluid mechanics is rapidly advancing, driven by unprecedented volumes of data from experiments, field measurements, and large-scale simulations at multiple spatiotemporal scales. Machine learning presents us with a wealth of techniques to extract information from data that can be translated into knowledge about the underlying fluid mechanics. Moreover, machine learning algorithms can augment domain knowledge and automate tasks related to flow control and optimization. This article presents an overview of past history, current developments, and emerging opportunities of machine learning for fluid mechanics. We outline fundamental machine learning methodologies and discuss their uses for understanding, modeling, optimizing, and controlling fluid flows. The strengths and limitations of these methods are addressed from the perspective of scientific inquiry that links data with modeling, experiments, and simulations. Machine learning provides a powerful information processing framework that can augment, and possibly even transform, current lines of fluid mechanics research and industrial applications. 

160__ Learning step sizes for unfolded sparse coding__arXiv:1905.11071
Author: Pierre Ablin
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11071
 Abstract: Sparse coding is typically solved by iterative optimization techniques, such as the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA). Unfolding and learning weights of ISTA using neural networks is a practical way to accelerate estimation. In this paper, we study the selection of adapted step sizes for ISTA. We show that a simple step size strategy can improve the convergence rate of ISTA by leveraging the sparsity of the iterates. However, it is impractical in most large-scale applications. Therefore, we propose a network architecture where only the step sizes of ISTA are learned. We demonstrate that for a large class of unfolded algorithms, if the algorithm converges to the solution of the Lasso, its last layers correspond to ISTA with learned step sizes. Experiments show that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art networks when the solutions are sparse enough. 

161__ Value Iteration Networks on Multiple Levels of Abstraction__arXiv:1905.11068
Author: Daniel Schleich
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11068
 Abstract: Learning-based methods are promising to plan robot motion without performing extensive search, which is needed by many non-learning approaches. Recently, Value Iteration Networks (VINs) received much interest since---in contrast to standard CNN-based architectures---they learn goal-directed behaviors which generalize well to unseen domains. However, VINs are restricted to small and low-dimensional domains, limiting their applicability to real-world planning problems. To address this issue, we propose to extend VINs to representations with multiple levels of abstraction. While the vicinity of the robot is represented in sufficient detail, the representation gets spatially coarser with increasing distance from the robot. The information loss caused by the decreasing resolution is compensated by increasing the number of features representing a cell. We show that our approach is capable of solving significantly larger 2D grid world planning tasks than the original VIN implementation. In contrast to a multiresolution coarse-to-fine VIN implementation which does not employ additional descriptive features, our approach is capable of solving challenging environments, which demonstrates that the proposed method learns to encode useful information in the additional features. As an application for solving real-world planning tasks, we successfully employ our method to plan omnidirectional driving for a search-and-rescue robot in cluttered terrain. 

162__ Locally Differentially Private Minimum Finding__arXiv:1905.11067
Author: Kazuto Fukuchi
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11067
 Abstract: We investigate a problem of finding the minimum, in which each user has a real value and we want to estimate the minimum of these values under the local differential privacy constraint. We reveal that this problem is fundamentally difficult, and we cannot construct a mechanism that is consistent in the worst case. Instead of considering the worst case, we aim to construct a private mechanism whose error rate is adaptive to the easiness of estimation of the minimum. As a measure of easiness, we introduce a parameter $\alpha$ that characterizes the fatness of the minimum-side tail of the user data distribution. As a result, we reveal that the mechanism can achieve $O((\ln^6N/\epsilon^2N)^{1/2\alpha})$ error without knowledge of $\alpha$ and the error rate is near-optimal in the sense that any mechanism incurs $\Omega((1/\epsilon^2N)^{1/2\alpha})$ error. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our mechanism outperforms a naive mechanism by empirical evaluations on synthetic datasets. Also, we conducted experiments on the MovieLens dataset and a purchase history dataset and demonstrate that our algorithm achieves $\tilde{O}((1/N)^{1/2\alpha})$ error adaptively to $\alpha$. 

163__ Neural Stochastic Differential Equations__arXiv:1905.11065
Author: Stefano Peluchetti
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11065
 Abstract: Deep neural networks whose parameters are distributed according to typical initialization schemes exhibit undesirable properties that can emerge as the number of layers increases. These issues include a vanishing dependency on the input and a concentration on restrictive families of functions including constant functions. We address these problems by considering the limit of infinite total depth and examine the conditions under which we achieve convergence to well-behaved continuous-time processes. Doing so we establish the connection between infinitely deep residual networks and solutions to stochastic differential equations, i.e. diffusion processes. We show that deep neural networks satisfying such connection don't suffer from the mentioned pathologies and analyze the SDE limits to shed light on their behavior. 

164__ Attention Based Image Compression Post-Processing Convolutional Neural  Network__arXiv:1905.11045
Author: Yuyang Xue
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11045
 Abstract: The traditional image compressors, e.g., BPG and H.266, have achieved great image and video compression quality. Recently, Convolutional Neural Network has been used widely in image compression. We proposed an attention-based convolutional neural network for low bit-rate compression to post-process the output of traditional image compression decoder. Across the experimental results on validation sets, the post-processing module trained by MAE and MS-SSIM losses yields the highest PSNR of 32.10 on average at the bit-rate of 0.15. 

165__ Best-scored Random Forest Classification__arXiv:1905.11028
Author: Hanyuan Hang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11028
 Abstract: We propose an algorithm named best-scored random forest for binary classification problems. The terminology "best-scored" means to select the one with the best empirical performance out of a certain number of purely random tree candidates as each single tree in the forest. In this way, the resulting forest can be more accurate than the original purely random forest. From the theoretical perspective, within the framework of regularized empirical risk minimization penalized on the number of splits, we establish almost optimal convergence rates for the proposed best-scored random trees under certain conditions which can be extended to the best-scored random forest. In addition, we present a counterexample to illustrate that in order to ensure the consistency of the forest, every dimension must have the chance to be split. In the numerical experiments, for the sake of efficiency, we employ an adaptive random splitting criterion. Comparative experiments with other state-of-art classification methods demonstrate the accuracy of our best-scored random forest. 

166__ An End-to-End Framework for Learning Multiple Conditional Network  Representations of Social Network__arXiv:1905.11013
Author: Hao Wang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11013
 Abstract: Recently, the Network Representation Learning (NRL) techniques, which represent graph structure via low-dimension vectors to support social-oriented application, have attracted wide attention. Though large efforts have been made, they may fail to describe the multiple aspects of similarity between social users, as only a single vector for one unique aspect has been represented for each node. To that end, in this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end framework named MCNE to learn multiple conditional network representations, so that various preferences for multiple behaviors could be fully captured. Specifically, we first design a binary mask layer to divide the single vector as conditional embeddings for multiple behaviors. Then, we introduce the attention network to model interaction relationship among multiple preferences, and further utilize the adapted message sending and receiving operation of graph neural network, so that multi-aspect preference information from high-order neighbors will be captured. Finally, we utilize Bayesian Personalized Ranking loss function to learn the preference similarity on each behavior, and jointly learn multiple conditional node embeddings via multi-task learning framework. Extensive experiments on public datasets validate that our MCNE framework could significantly outperform several state-of-the-art baselines, and further support the visualization and transfer learning tasks with excellent interpretability and robustness. 

167__ Robustness of accelerated first-order algorithms for strongly convex  optimization problems__arXiv:1905.11011
Author: Hesameddin Mohammadi
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11011
 Abstract: We study the robustness of accelerated first-order algorithms to stochastic uncertainties in gradient evaluation. Specifically, for unconstrained, smooth, strongly convex optimization problems, we examine the mean-square error in the optimization variable when the iterates are perturbed by additive white noise. This type of uncertainty may arise in situations where an approximation of the gradient is sought through measurements of a real system or in a distributed computation over network. Even though the underlying dynamics of first-order algorithms for this class of problems are nonlinear, we establish upper bounds on the mean-square deviation from the optimal value that are tight up to constant factors. Our analysis quantifies fundamental trade-offs between noise amplification and convergence rates obtained via any acceleration scheme similar to Nesterov's or heavy-ball methods. To gain additional analytical insight, for strongly convex quadratic problems we explicitly evaluate the steady-state variance of the optimization variable in terms of the eigenvalues of the Hessian of the objective function. We demonstrate that the entire spectrum of the Hessian, rather than just the extreme eigenvalues, influence robustness of noisy algorithms. We specialize this result to the problem of distributed averaging over undirected networks and examine the role of network size and topology on the robustness of noisy accelerated algorithms. 

168__ Adaptive probabilistic principal component analysis__arXiv:1905.11010
Author: Adam Farooq
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11010
 Abstract: Using the linear Gaussian latent variable model as a starting point we relax some of the constraints it imposes by deriving a nonparametric latent feature Gaussian variable model. This model introduces additional discrete latent variables to the original structure. The Bayesian nonparametric nature of this new model allows it to adapt complexity as more data is observed and project each data point onto a varying number of subspaces. The linear relationship between the continuous latent and observed variables make the proposed model straightforward to interpret, resembling a locally adaptive probabilistic PCA (A-PPCA). We propose two alternative Gibbs sampling procedures for inference in the new model and demonstrate its applicability on sensor data for passive health monitoring. 

169__ Dirichlet Simplex Nest and Geometric Inference__arXiv:1905.11009
Author: Mikhail Yurochkin
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11009
 Abstract: We propose Dirichlet Simplex Nest, a class of probabilistic models suitable for a variety of data types, and develop fast and provably accurate inference algorithms by accounting for the model's convex geometry and low dimensional simplicial structure. By exploiting the connection to Voronoi tessellation and properties of Dirichlet distribution, the proposed inference algorithm is shown to achieve consistency and strong error bound guarantees on a range of model settings and data distributions. The effectiveness of our model and the learning algorithm is demonstrated by simulations and by analyses of text and financial data. 

170__ Levenshtein Transformer__arXiv:1905.11006
Author: Jiatao Gu
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11006
 Abstract: Modern neural sequence generation models are built to either generate tokens step-by-step from scratch or (iteratively) modify a sequence of tokens bounded by a fixed length. In this work, we develop Levenshtein Transformer, a new partially autoregressive model devised for more flexible and amenable sequence generation. Unlike previous approaches, the atomic operations of our model are insertion and deletion. The combination of them facilitates not only generation but also sequence refinement allowing dynamic length changes. We also propose a set of new training techniques dedicated at them, effectively exploiting one as the other's learning signal thanks to their complementary nature. Experiments applying the proposed model achieve comparable performance but much-improved efficiency on both generation (e.g. machine translation, text summarization) and refinement tasks (e.g. automatic post-editing). We further confirm the flexibility of our model by showing a Levenshtein Transformer trained by machine translation can straightforwardly be used for automatic post-editing. 

171__ Improved Calibration and Predictive Uncertainty for  Deep Neural Networks__arXiv:1905.11001
Author: Sunil Thulasidasan
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11001
 Abstract: Mixup~\cite{zhang2017mixup} is a recently proposed method for training deep neural networks where additional samples are generated during training by convexly combining random pairs of images and their associated labels. While simple to implement, it has shown to be a surprisingly effective method of data augmentation for image classification; DNNs trained with mixup show noticeable gains in classification performance on a number of image classification benchmarks. In this work, we discuss a hitherto untouched aspect of mixup training -- the calibration and predictive uncertainty of models trained with mixup. We find that DNNs trained with mixup are significantly better calibrated -- i.e., the predicted softmax scores are much better indicators of the actual likelihood of a correct prediction -- than DNNs trained in the regular fashion. We conduct experiments on a number of image classification architectures and datasets -- including large-scale datasets like ImageNet -- and find this to be the case. Additionally, we find that merely mixing features does not result in the same calibration benefit and that the label smoothing in mixup training plays a significant role in improving calibration. Finally, we also observe that mixup-trained DNNs are less prone to over-confident predictions on out-of-distribution and random-noise data. We conclude that the typical overconfidence seen in neural networks, even on in-distribution data is likely a consequence of training with hard labels, suggesting that mixup training be employed for classification tasks where predictive uncertainty is a significant concern. error here, check on website.

173__ An Intelligent Monitoring System of Vehicles on Highway Traffic__arXiv:1905.10982
Author: Sulaiman Khan
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10982
 Abstract: Vehicle speed monitoring and management of highways is the critical problem of the road in this modern age of growing technology and population. A poor management results in frequent traffic jam, traffic rules violation and fatal road accidents. Using traditional techniques of RADAR, LIDAR and LASAR to address this problem is time-consuming, expensive and tedious. This paper presents an efficient framework to produce a simple, cost efficient and intelligent system for vehicle speed monitoring. The proposed method uses an HD (High Definition) camera mounted on the road side either on a pole or on a traffic signal for recording video frames. On the basis of these frames, a vehicle can be tracked by using radius growing method, and its speed can be calculated by calculating vehicle mask and its displacement in consecutive frames. The method uses pattern recognition, digital image processing and mathematical techniques for vehicle detection, tracking and speed calculation. The validity of the proposed model is proved by testing it on different highways.

 Abstract: Research on social-media platforms has tended to rely on textual analysis to perform research tasks. While text-based approaches have significantly increased our understanding of online behavior and social dynamics, they overlook features on these platforms that have grown in prominence in the past few years: click-based responses to content. In this paper, we present a new dataset of Facebook Reactions to scholarly content. We give an overview of its structure, analyze some of the statistical trends in the data, and use it to train and test two supervised learning algorithms. Our preliminary tests suggest the presence of stratification in the number of users following pages, divisions that seem to fall in line with distinctions in the subject matter of those pages. error here, check on website.

176__ Scalable Training of Inference Networks for Gaussian-Process Models__arXiv:1905.10969
Author: Jiaxin Shi
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10969
 Abstract: Inference in Gaussian process (GP) models is computationally challenging for large data, and often difficult to approximate with a small number of inducing points. We explore an alternative approximation that employs stochastic inference networks for a flexible inference. Unfortunately, for such networks, minibatch training is difficult to be able to learn meaningful correlations over function outputs for a large dataset. We propose an algorithm that enables such training by tracking a stochastic, functional mirror-descent algorithm. At each iteration, this only requires considering a finite number of input locations, resulting in a scalable and easy-to-implement algorithm. Empirical results show comparable and, sometimes, superior performance to existing sparse variational GP methods. 

177__ Combating Label Noise in Deep Learning Using Abstention__arXiv:1905.10964
Author: Sunil Thulasidasan
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10964
 Abstract: We introduce a novel method to combat label noise when training deep neural networks for classification. We propose a loss function that permits abstention during training thereby allowing the DNN to abstain on confusing samples while continuing to learn and improve classification performance on the non-abstained samples. We show how such a deep abstaining classifier (DAC) can be used for robust learning in the presence of different types of label noise. In the case of structured or systematic label noise -- where noisy training labels or confusing examples are correlated with underlying features of the data-- training with abstention enables representation learning for features that are associated with unreliable labels. In the case of unstructured (arbitrary) label noise, abstention during training enables the DAC to be used as an effective data cleaner by identifying samples that are likely to have label noise. We provide analytical results on the loss function behavior that enable dynamic adaption of abstention rates based on learning progress during training. We demonstrate the utility of the deep abstaining classifier for various image classification tasks under different types of label noise; in the case of arbitrary label noise, we show significant improvements over previously published results on multiple image benchmarks. 

178__ Fast Convergence of Natural Gradient Descent for Overparameterized  Neural Networks__arXiv:1905.10961
Author: Guodong Zhang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10961
 Abstract: Natural gradient descent has proven effective at mitigating the effects of pathological curvature in neural network optimization, but little is known theoretically about its convergence properties, especially for \emph{nonlinear} networks. In this work, we analyze \emph{for the first time} the speed of convergence for natural gradient descent on nonlinear neural networks with the squared-error loss. We identify two conditions which guarantee the efficient convergence from random initializations: (1) the Jacobian matrix (of network's output for all training cases with respect to the parameters) is full row rank, and (2) the Jacobian matrix is stable for small perturbations around the initialization. For two-layer ReLU neural networks (i.e., with one hidden layer), we prove that these two conditions do in fact hold throughout the training, under the assumptions of nondegenerate inputs and overparameterization. We further extend our analysis to more general loss functions. Lastly, we show that K-FAC, an approximate natural gradient descent method, also converges to global minima under the same assumptions. 

179__ Dynamically Visual Disambiguation of Keyword-based Image Search__arXiv:1905.10955
Author: Yazhou Yao
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10955
 Abstract: Due to the high cost of manual annotation, learning directly from the web has attracted broad attention. One issue that limits their performance is the problem of visual polysemy. To address this issue, we present an adaptive multi-model framework that resolves polysemy by visual disambiguation. Compared to existing methods, the primary advantage of our approach lies in that our approach can adapt to the dynamic changes in the search results. Our proposed framework consists of two major steps: we first discover and dynamically select the text queries according to the image search results, then we employ the proposed saliency-guided deep multi-instance learning network to remove outliers and learn classification models for visual disambiguation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach. 

180__ Incremental Learning Using a Grow-and-Prune Paradigm with Efficient  Neural Networks__arXiv:1905.10952
Author: Xiaoliang Dai
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10952
 Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become a widely deployed model for numerous machine learning applications. However, their fixed architecture, substantial training cost, and significant model redundancy make it difficult to efficiently update them to accommodate previously unseen data. To solve these problems, we propose an incremental learning framework based on a grow-and-prune neural network synthesis paradigm. When new data arrive, the neural network first grows new connections based on the gradients to increase the network capacity to accommodate new data. Then, the framework iteratively prunes away connections based on the magnitude of weights to enhance network compactness, and hence recover efficiency. Finally, the model rests at a lightweight DNN that is both ready for inference and suitable for future grow-and-prune updates. The proposed framework improves accuracy, shrinks network size, and significantly reduces the additional training cost for incoming data compared to conventional approaches, such as training from scratch and network fine-tuning. For the LeNet-300-100 and LeNet-5 neural network architectures derived for the MNIST dataset, the framework reduces training cost by up to 64% (63%) and 67% (63%) compared to training from scratch (network fine-tuning), respectively. For the ResNet-18 architecture derived for the ImageNet dataset and DeepSpeech2 for the AN4 dataset, the corresponding training cost reductions against training from scratch (network fine-tunning) are 64% (60%) and 67% (62%), respectively. Our derived models contain fewer network parameters but achieve higher accuracy relative to conventional baselines. 

181__ Semi-supervised GAN for Classification of Multispectral Imagery Acquired  by UAVs__arXiv:1905.10920
Author: Hamideh Kerdegari
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10920
 Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are used in precision agriculture (PA) to enable aerial monitoring of farmlands. Intelligent methods are required to pinpoint weed infestations and make optimal choice of pesticide. UAV can fly a multispectral camera and collect data. However, the classification of multispectral images using supervised machine learning algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) requires large amount of training data. This is a common drawback in deep learning we try to circumvent making use of a semi-supervised generative adversarial networks (GAN), providing a pixel-wise classification for all the acquired multispectral images. Our algorithm consists of a generator network that provides photo-realistic images as extra training data to a multi-class classifier, acting as a discriminator and trained on small amounts of labeled data. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on the weedNet dataset consisting of multispectral crop and weed images collected by a micro aerial vehicle (MAV). The results by the proposed semi-supervised GAN achieves high classification accuracy and demonstrates the potential of GAN-based methods for the challenging task of multispectral image classification. 

182__ Spectral Domain Convolutional Neural Network__arXiv:1905.10915
Author: Bochen Guan
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10915
 Abstract: The memory consumption of most Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures grows rapidly with increasing depth of the network, which is a major constraint for efficient network training and inference on modern GPUs with yet limited memory. Several studies show that the feature maps (as generated after the convolutional layers) are the big bottleneck in this memory problem. Often, these feature maps mimic natural photographs in the sense that their energy is concentrated in the spectral domain. This paper proposes a Spectral Domain Convolutional Neural Network (SpecNet) that performs both the convolution and the activation operations in the spectral domain to achieve memory reduction. SpecNet exploits a configurable threshold to force small values in the feature maps to zero, allowing the feature maps to be stored sparsely. Since convolution in the spatial domain is equivalent to a dot product in the spectral domain, the multiplications only need to be performed on the non-zero entries of the (sparse) spectral domain feature maps. SpecNet also employs a special activation function that preserves the sparsity of the feature maps while effectively encouraging the convergence of the network. The performance of SpecNet is evaluated on three competitive object recognition benchmark tasks (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN), and compared with four state-of-the-art implementations (LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, and DenseNet). Overall, SpecNet is able to reduce memory consumption by about 60% without significant loss of performance for all tested network architectures.

 Abstract: We study reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) on a Riemannian manifold. In particular, we discuss under which condition Sobolev spaces are RKHS and characterize their reproducing kernels. Further, we introduce and discuss a class of smoother RKHS that we call diffusion spaces. We illustrate the general results with a number of detailed examples. 

184__ A hybrid model for predicting human physical activity status from  lifelogging data__arXiv:1905.10891
Author: Ji Ni
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10891
 Abstract: One trend in the recent healthcare transformations is people are encouraged to monitor and manage their health based on their daily diets and physical activity habits. However, much attention of the use of operational research and analytical models in healthcare has been paid to the systematic level such as country or regional policy making or organisational issues. This paper proposes a model concerned with healthcare analytics at the individual level, which can predict human physical activity status from sequential lifelogging data collected from wearable sensors. The model has a two-stage hybrid structure (in short, MOGP-HMM) -- a multi-objective genetic programming (MOGP) algorithm in the first stage to reduce the dimensions of lifelogging data and a hidden Markov model (HMM) in the second stage for activity status prediction over time. It can be used as a decision support tool to provide real-time monitoring, statistical analysis and personalized advice to individuals, encouraging positive attitudes towards healthy lifestyles. We validate the model with the real data collected from a group of participants in the UK, and compare it with other popular two-stage hybrid models. Our experimental results show that the MOGP-HMM can achieve comparable performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the very first study that uses the MOGP in the hybrid two-stage structure for individuals\rq{} activity status prediction. It fits seamlessly with the current trend in the UK healthcare transformation of patient empowerment as well as contributing to a strategic development for more efficient and cost-effective provision of healthcare. 

185__ Optimizing Generalized PageRank Methods for Seed-Expansion Community  Detection__arXiv:1905.10881
Author: Pan Li
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10881
 Abstract: Landing probabilities (LP) of random walks (RW) over graphs encode rich information regarding graph topology. Generalized PageRanks (GPR), which represent weighted sums of LPs of RWs, utilize the discriminative power of LP features to enable many graph-based learning studies. Previous work in the area has mostly focused on evaluating suitable weights for GPRs, and only a few studies so far have attempted to derive the optimal weights of GRPs for a given application. We take a fundamental step forward in this direction by using random graph models to better our understanding of the behavior of GPRs. In this context, we provide a rigorous non-asymptotic analysis for the convergence of LPs and GPRs to their mean-field values on edge-independent random graphs. Although our theoretical results apply to many problem settings, we focus on the task of seed-expansion community detection over stochastic block models. There, we find that the predictive power of LPs decreases significantly slower than previously reported based on asymptotic findings. Given this result, we propose a new GPR, termed Inverse PR (IPR), with LP weights that increase for the initial few steps of the walks. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real, large-scale networks illustrate the superiority of IPR compared to other GPRs for seeded community detection. 

186__ Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action via Counterfactual Predictions__arXiv:1905.10870
Author: Yixin Wang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10870
 Abstract: Machine learning (ML) can automate decision-making by learning to predict decisions from historical data. However, these predictors may inherit discriminatory policies from past decisions and reproduce unfair decisions. In this paper, we propose two algorithms that adjust fitted ML predictors to make them fair. We focus on two legal notions of fairness: (a) providing equal opportunity (EO) to individuals regardless of sensitive attributes and (b) repairing historical disadvantages through affirmative action (AA). More technically, we produce fair EO and AA predictors by positing a causal model and considering counterfactual decisions. We prove that the resulting predictors are theoretically optimal in predictive performance while satisfying fairness. We evaluate the algorithms, and the trade-offs between accuracy and fairness, on datasets about admissions, income, credit and recidivism. 

187__ Physics-informed Autoencoders for Lyapunov-stable Fluid Flow Prediction__arXiv:1905.10866
Author: N. Benjamin Erichson
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10866
 Abstract: In addition to providing high-profile successes in computer vision and natural language processing, neural networks also provide an emerging set of techniques for scientific problems. Such data-driven models, however, typically ignore physical insights from the scientific system under consideration. Among other things, a physics-informed model formulation should encode some degree of stability or robustness or well-conditioning (in that a small change of the input will not lead to drastic changes in the output), characteristic of the underlying scientific problem. We investigate whether it is possible to include physics-informed prior knowledge for improving the model quality (e.g., generalization performance, sensitivity to parameter tuning, or robustness in the presence of noisy data). To that extent, we focus on the stability of an equilibrium, one of the most basic properties a dynamic system can have, via the lens of Lyapunov analysis. For the prototypical problem of fluid flow prediction, we show that models preserving Lyapunov stability improve the generalization error and reduce the prediction uncertainty. 

188__ Automatic Discovery of Privacy-Utility Pareto Fronts__arXiv:1905.10862
Author: Brendan Avent
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10862
 Abstract: Differential privacy is a mathematical framework for privacy-preserving data analysis. Changing the hyperparameters of a differentially private algorithm allows one to trade off privacy and utility in a principled way. Quantifying this trade-off in advance is essential to decision-makers tasked with deciding how much privacy can be provided in a particular application while keeping acceptable utility. For more complex tasks, such as training neural networks under differential privacy, the utility achieved by a given algorithm can only be measured empirically. This paper presents a Bayesian optimization methodology for efficiently characterizing the privacy-utility trade-off of any differentially private algorithm using only empirical measurements of its utility. The versatility of our method is illustrated on a number of machine learning tasks involving multiple models, optimizers, and datasets. 

189__ Temporal Attentive Alignment for Video Domain Adaptation__arXiv:1905.10861
Author: Chen
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10861
 Abstract: Although various image-based domain adaptation (DA) techniques have been proposed in recent years, domain shift in videos is still not well-explored. Most previous works only evaluate performance on small-scale datasets which are saturated. Therefore, we first propose a larger-scale dataset with larger domain discrepancy: UCF-HMDB_full. Second, we investigate different DA integration methods for videos, and show that simultaneously aligning and learning temporal dynamics achieves effective alignment even without sophisticated DA methods. Finally, we propose Temporal Attentive Adversarial Adaptation Network (TA3N), which explicitly attends to the temporal dynamics using domain discrepancy for more effective domain alignment, achieving state-of-the-art performance on three video DA datasets. We plan to release the code and datasets. 

190__ Variational Bayes under Model Misspecification__arXiv:1905.10859
Author: Yixin Wang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10859
 Abstract: Variational Bayes (VB) is a scalable alternative to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for Bayesian posterior inference. Though popular, VB comes with few theoretical guarantees, most of which focus on well-specified models. However, models are rarely well-specified in practice. In this work, we study VB under model misspecification. We prove the VB posterior is asymptotically normal and centers at the value that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to the true data-generating distribution. Moreover, the VB posterior mean centers at the same value and is also asymptotically normal. These results generalize the variational Bernstein--von Mises theorem [29] to misspecified models. As a consequence of these results, we find that the model misspecification error dominates the variational approximation error in VB posterior predictive distributions. It explains the widely observed phenomenon that VB achieves comparable predictive accuracy with MCMC even though VB uses an approximating family. As illustrations, we study VB under three forms of model misspecification, ranging from model over-/under-dispersion to latent dimensionality misspecification. We conduct two simulation studies that demonstrate the theoretical results. 

191__ Gaussian DAGs on network data__arXiv:1905.10848
Author: Hangjian Li
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10848
 Abstract: The traditional directed acyclic graph (DAG) model assumes data are generated independently from the underlying joint distribution defined by the DAG. In many applications, however, individuals are linked via a network and thus the independence assumption does not hold. We propose a novel Gaussian DAG model for network data, where the dependence among individual data points (row covariance) is modeled by an undirected graph. Under this model, we develop a maximum penalized likelihood method to estimate the DAG structure and the row correlation matrix. The algorithm iterates between a decoupled lasso regression step and a graphical lasso step. We show with extensive simulated and real network data, that our algorithm improves the accuracy of DAG structure learning by leveraging the information from the estimated row correlations. Moreover, we demonstrate that the performance of existing DAG learning methods can be substantially improved via de-correlation of network data with the estimated row correlation matrix from our algorithm. 

192__ empirical data v.s.  Teacher-Student paradigm__arXiv:1905.10843
Author: Stefano Spigler
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10843
 Abstract: How many training data are needed to learn a supervised task? It is often observed that the generalization error decreases as $n^{-\beta}$ where $n$ is the number of training examples and $\beta$ an exponent that depends on both data and algorithm. In this work we measure $\beta$ when applying kernel methods to real datasets. For MNIST we find $\beta\approx 0.4$ and for CIFAR10 $\beta\approx 0.1$. Remarkably, $\beta$ is the same for regression and classification tasks, and for Gaussian or Laplace kernels. To rationalize the existence of non-trivial exponents that can be independent of the specific kernel used, we introduce the Teacher-Student framework for kernels. In this scheme, a Teacher generates data according to a Gaussian random field, and a Student learns them via kernel regression. With a simplifying assumption --- namely that the data are sampled from a regular lattice --- we derive analytically $\beta$ for translation invariant kernels, using previous results from the kriging literature. Provided that the Student is not too sensitive to high frequencies, $\beta$ depends only on the training data and their dimension. We confirm numerically that these predictions hold when the training points are sampled at random on a hypersphere. Overall, our results quantify how smooth Gaussian data should be to avoid the curse of dimensionality, and indicate that for kernel learning the relevant dimension of the data should be defined in terms of how the distance between nearest data points depends on $n$. With this definition one obtains reasonable effective smoothness estimates for MNIST and CIFAR10. 

193__ Feature Map Transform Coding for Energy-Efficient CNN Inference__arXiv:1905.10830
Author: Brian Chmiel
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10830
 Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in a variety of tasks in computer vision and beyond. One of the major obstacles hindering the ubiquitous use of CNNs for inference on low-power edge devices is their relatively high computational complexity and memory bandwidth requirements. The latter often dominates the energy footprint on modern hardware. In this paper, we introduce a lossy transform coding approach, inspired by image and video compression, designed to reduce the memory bandwidth due to the storage of intermediate activation calculation results. Our method exploits the high correlations between feature maps and adjacent pixels and allows to halve the data transfer volumes to the main memory without re-training. We analyze the performance of our approach on a variety of CNN architectures and demonstrated FPGA implementation of ResNet18 with our approach results in reduction of around 40% in the memory energy footprint compared to quantized network with negligible impact on accuracy. A reference implementation is available at this https URL error here, check on website.

195__ Usage of multiple RTL features for Earthquake prediction__arXiv:1905.10805
Author: P. Proskura
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10805
 Abstract: We construct a classification model that predicts if an earthquake with the magnitude above a threshold will take place at a given location in a time range 30-180 days from a given moment of time. A common approach is to use expert forecasts based on features like Region-Time-Length (RTL) characteristics. The proposed approach uses machine learning on top of multiple RTL features to take into account effects at various scales and to improve prediction accuracy. For historical data about Japan earthquakes 1992-2005 and predictions at locations given in this database the best model has precision up to ~ 0.95 and recall up to ~ 0.98. 

196__ Path Ranking with Attention to Type Hierarchies__arXiv:1905.10799
Author: Weiyu Liu
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10799
 Abstract: The knowledge base completion problem is the problem of inferring missing information from existing facts in knowledge bases. Path-ranking based methods use sequences of relations as general patterns of paths for prediction. However, these patterns usually lack accuracy because they are generic and can often apply to widely varying scenarios. We leverage type hierarchies of entities to create a new class of path patterns that are both discriminative and generalizable. Then we propose an attention-based RNN model, which can be trained end-to-end, to discover the new path patterns most suitable for the data. Experiments conducted on two benchmark knowledge base completion datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing methods by a statistically significant margin. Our quantitative analysis of the path patterns shows that they balance between generalization and discrimination. 

197__ Online Deep Learning for Improved Trajectory Tracking of Unmanned Aerial  Vehicles Using Expert Knowledge__arXiv:1905.10796
Author: Andriy Sarabakha
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10796
 Abstract: This work presents an online learning-based control method for improved trajectory tracking of unmanned aerial vehicles using both deep learning and expert knowledge. The proposed method does not require the exact model of the system to be controlled, and it is robust against variations in system dynamics as well as operational uncertainties. The learning is divided into two phases: offline (pre-)training and online (post-)training. In the former, a conventional controller performs a set of trajectories and, based on the input-output dataset, the deep neural network (DNN)-based controller is trained. In the latter, the trained DNN, which mimics the conventional controller, controls the system. Unlike the existing papers in the literature, the network is still being trained for different sets of trajectories which are not used in the training phase of DNN. Thanks to the rule-base, which contains the expert knowledge, the proposed framework learns the system dynamics and operational uncertainties in real-time. The experimental results show that the proposed online learning-based approach gives better trajectory tracking performance when compared to the only offline trained network. 

198__ Flexible Quantization Strategies for Neural Networks__arXiv:1905.10759
Author: Yash Akhauri
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10759
 Abstract: On-board processing elements on UAVs are currently inadequate for training and inference of Deep Neural Networks. This is largely due to the energy consumption of memory accesses in such a network. HadaNets introduce a flexible train-from-scratch tensor quantization scheme by pairing a full precision tensor to a binary tensor in the form of a Hadamard product. Unlike wider reduced precision neural network models, we preserve the train-time parameter count, thus out-performing XNOR-Nets without a train-time memory penalty. Such training routines could see great utility in semi-supervised online learning tasks. Our method also offers advantages in model compression, as we reduce the model size of ResNet-18 by 7.43 times with respect to a full precision model without utilizing any other compression techniques. We also demonstrate a 'Hadamard Binary Matrix Multiply' kernel, which delivers a 10-fold increase in performance over full precision matrix multiplication with a similarly optimized kernel. 

199__ Auditory Separation of a Conversation from Background via Attentional  Gating__arXiv:1905.10751
Author: Shariq Mobin
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10751
 Abstract: We present a model for separating a set of voices out of a sound mixture containing an unknown number of sources. Our Attentional Gating Network (AGN) uses a variable attentional context to specify which speakers in the mixture are of interest. The attentional context is specified by an embedding vector which modifies the processing of a neural network through an additive bias. Individual speaker embeddings are learned to separate a single speaker while superpositions of the individual speaker embeddings are used to separate sets of speakers. We first evaluate AGN on a traditional single speaker separation task and show an improvement of 9% with respect to comparable models. Then, we introduce a new task to separate an arbitrary subset of voices from a mixture of an unknown-sized set of voices, inspired by the human ability to separate a conversation of interest from background chatter at a cafeteria. We show that AGN is the only model capable of solving this task, performing only 7% worse than on the single speaker separation task. 

200__ A unified construction for series representations and finite  approximations of completely random measures__arXiv:1905.10733
Author: Juho Lee
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10733
 Abstract: Infinite-activity completely random measures (CRMs) have become important building blocks of complex Bayesian nonparametric models. They have been successfully used in various applications such as clustering, density estimation, latent feature models, survival analysis or network science. Popular infinite-activity CRMs include the (generalized) gamma process and the (stable) beta process. However, except in some specific cases, exact simulation or scalable inference with these models is challenging and finite-dimensional approximations are often considered. In this work, we propose a general and unified framework to derive both series representations and finite-dimensional approximations of CRMs. Our framework can be seen as an extension of constructions based on size-biased sampling of Poisson point process [Perman1992]. It includes as special cases several known series representations as well as novel ones. In particular, we show that one can get novel series representations for the generalized gamma process and the stable beta process. We also provide some analysis of the truncation error. 

201__ Efficient Curvature Estimation for Oriented Point Clouds__arXiv:1905.10725
Author: Yueqi Cao
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10725
 Abstract: There is an immense literature focused on estimating the curvature of an unknown surface from point cloud dataset. Most existing algorithms estimate the curvature indirectly, that is, to estimate the surface locally by some basis functions and then calculate the curvature of such surface as an estimate of the curvature. Recently several methods have been proposed to estimate the curvature directly. However, these algorithms lack of theoretical guarantee on estimation error on small to moderate datasets. In this paper, we propose a direct and efficient method to estimate the curvature for oriented point cloud data without any surface approximation. In fact, we estimate the Weingarten map using a least square method, so that Gaussian curvature, mean curvature and principal curvatures can be obtained automatically from the Weingarten map. We show the convergence rate of our Weingarten Map Estimation (WME) algorithm is $n^{-2/3}$ both theoretically and numerically. Finally, we apply our method to point cloud simplification and surface reconstruction. 

202__ Underwater Fish Detection with Weak Multi-Domain Supervision__arXiv:1905.10708
Author: Dmitry A. Konovalov
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10708
 Abstract: Given a sufficiently large training dataset, it is relatively easy to train a modern convolution neural network (CNN) as a required image classifier. However, for the task of fish classification and/or fish detection, if a CNN was trained to detect or classify particular fish species in particular background habitats, the same CNN exhibits much lower accuracy when applied to new/unseen fish species and/or fish habitats. Therefore, in practice, the CNN needs to be continuously fine-tuned to improve its classification accuracy to handle new project-specific fish species or habitats. In this work we present a labelling-efficient method of training a CNN-based fish-detector (the Xception CNN was used as the base) on relatively small numbers (4,000) of project-domain underwater fish/no-fish images from 20 different habitats. Additionally, 17,000 of known negative (that is, missing fish) general-domain (VOC2012) above-water images were used. Two publicly available fish-domain datasets supplied additional 27,000 of above-water and underwater positive/fish images. By using this multi-domain collection of images, the trained Xception-based binary (fish/not-fish) classifier achieved 0.17% false-positives and 0.61% false-negatives on the project's 20,000 negative and 16,000 positive holdout test images, respectively. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 99.94%. 

203__ Modeling treatment events in disease progression__arXiv:1905.10705
Author: Guanyang Wang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10705
 Abstract: Ability to quantify and predict progression of a disease is fundamental for selecting an appropriate treatment. Many clinical metrics cannot be acquired frequently either because of their cost (e.g. MRI, gait analysis) or because they are inconvenient or harmful to a patient (e.g. biopsy, x-ray). In such scenarios, in order to estimate individual trajectories of disease progression, it is advantageous to leverage similarities between patients, i.e. the covariance of trajectories, and find a latent representation of progression. Most of existing methods for estimating trajectories do not account for events in-between observations, what dramatically decreases their adequacy for clinical practice. In this study, we develop a machine learning framework named Coordinatewise-Soft-Impute (CSI) for analyzing disease progression from sparse observations in the presence of confounding events. CSI is guaranteed to converge to the global minimum of the corresponding optimization problem. Experimental results also demonstrates the effectiveness of CSI using both simulated and real dataset. 

204__ Multi Distance Embeddings for Link Prediction in Knowledge Graphs__arXiv:1905.10702
Author: Afshin Sadeghi
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10702
 Abstract: Over the past decade, knowledge graphs became popular for capturing structured domain knowledge. Relational learning models enable the prediction of missing links inside knowledge graphs. More specifically, latent distance approaches model the relationships among entities via a distance between latent representations. Translating embedding models (e.g., TransE) are among the most popular latent distance approaches which use one distance function to learn multiple relation patterns. However, they are not capable of capturing symmetric relations. They also force relations with reflexive patterns to become symmetric and transitive. In order to improve distance based embedding, we propose multi-distance embeddings (MDE). Our solution is based on the idea that by learning independent embedding vectors for each entity and relation one can aggregate contrasting distance functions. Benefiting from MDE, we also develop supplementary distances resolving the above-mentioned limitations of TransE. We further propose an extended loss function for distance based embeddings and show that MDE and TransE are fully expressive using this loss function. Furthermore, we obtain a bound on the size of their embeddings for full expressivity. Our empirical results show that MDE significantly improves the translating embeddings and outperforms several state-of-the-art embedding models on benchmark datasets. 

205__ Hierarchical Invertible Neural Transport for General and  Sequential Bayesian inference__arXiv:1905.10687
Author: Gianluca Detommaso
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10687
 Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Hierarchical Invertible Neural Transport (HINT), an algorithm that merges Invertible Neural Networks and optimal transport to sample from a posterior distribution in a Bayesian framework. This method exploits a hierarchical architecture to construct a Knothe-Rosenblatt transport map between an arbitrary density and the joint density of hidden variables and observations. After training the map, samples from the posterior can be immediately recovered for any contingent observation. Any underlying model evaluation can be performed fully offline from training without the need of a model-gradient. Furthermore, no analytical evaluation of the prior is necessary, which makes HINT an ideal candidate for sequential Bayesian inference. We demonstrate the efficacy of HINT on two numerical experiments. 

206__ The Plenty Pantry__arXiv:1905.10686
Author: Nicole Mcke
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10686
 Abstract: A common strategy to train deep neural networks (DNNs) is to use very large architectures and to train them until they (almost) achieve zero training error. Empirically observed good generalization performance on test data, even in the presence of lots of label noise, corroborate such a procedure. On the other hand, in statistical learning theory it is known that over-fitting models may lead to poor generalization properties, occurring in e.g. empirical risk minimization (ERM) over too large hypotheses classes. Inspired by this contradictory behavior, so-called interpolation methods have recently received much attention, leading to consistent and optimally learning methods for some local averaging schemes with zero training error. However, there is no theoretical analysis of interpolating ERM-like methods so far. We take a step in this direction by showing that for certain, large hypotheses classes, some interpolating ERMs enjoy very good statistical guarantees while others fail in the worst sense. Moreover, we show that the same phenomenon occurs for DNNs with zero training error and sufficiently large architectures. 

207__ Dense-and-Implicit Attention Network__arXiv:1905.10671
Author: Zhongzhan Huang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10671
 Abstract: Attention-based deep neural networks (DNNs) that emphasize the informative information in a local receptive field of an input image have successfully boosted the performance of deep learning in various challenging problems. In this paper, we propose a Dense-and-Implicit-Attention (DIA) unit that can be applied universally to different network architectures and enhance their generalization capacity by repeatedly fusing the information throughout different network layers. The communication of information between different layers is carried out via a modified Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) module within the DIA unit that is in parallel with the DNN. The sharing DIA unit links multi-scale features from different depth levels of the network implicitly and densely. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that the DIA unit is capable of emphasizing channel-wise feature interrelation and leads to significant improvement of image classification accuracy. We further empirically show that the DIA unit is a nonlocal normalization tool that enhances the Batch Normalization. The code is released at this https URL 

208__ Is a Single Vector Enough? Exploring Node Polysemy for Network Embedding__arXiv:1905.10668
Author: Ninghao Liu
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10668
 Abstract: Networks have been widely used as the data structure for abstracting real-world systems as well as organizing the relations among entities. Network embedding models are powerful tools in mapping nodes in a network into continuous vector-space representations in order to facilitate subsequent tasks such as classification and link prediction. Existing network embedding models comprehensively integrate all information of each node, such as links and attributes, towards a single embedding vector to represent the node's general role in the network. However, a real-world entity could be multifaceted, where it connects to different neighborhoods due to different motives or self-characteristics that are not necessarily correlated. For example, in a movie recommender system, a user may love comedies or horror movies simultaneously, but it is not likely that these two types of movies are mutually close in the embedding space, nor the user embedding vector could be sufficiently close to them at the same time. In this paper, we propose a polysemous embedding approach for modeling multiple facets of nodes, as motivated by the phenomenon of word polysemy in language modeling. Each facet of a node is mapped as an embedding vector, while we also maintain association degree between each pair of node and facet. The proposed method is adaptive to various existing embedding models, without significantly complicating the optimization process. We also discuss how to engage embedding vectors of different facets for inference tasks including classification and link prediction. Experiments on real-world datasets help comprehensively evaluate the performance of the proposed method. 

209__ An Ensemble of Bayesian Neural Networks for Exoplanetary Atmospheric  Retrieval__arXiv:1905.10659
Author: Adam D. Cobb
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10659
 Abstract: Machine learning is now used in many areas of astrophysics, from detecting exoplanets in Kepler transit signals to removing telescope systematics. Recent work demonstrated the potential of using machine learning algorithms for atmospheric retrieval by implementing a random forest to perform retrievals in seconds that are consistent with the traditional, computationally-expensive nested-sampling retrieval method. We expand upon their approach by presenting a new machine learning model, \texttt{plan-net}, based on an ensemble of Bayesian neural networks that yields more accurate inferences than the random forest for the same data set of synthetic transmission spectra. We demonstrate that an ensemble provides greater accuracy and more robust uncertainties than a single model. In addition to being the first to use Bayesian neural networks for atmospheric retrieval, we also introduce a new loss function for Bayesian neural networks that learns correlations between the model outputs. Importantly, we show that designing machine learning models to explicitly incorporate domain-specific knowledge both improves performance and provides additional insight by inferring the covariance of the retrieved atmospheric parameters. We apply \texttt{plan-net} to the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 transmission spectrum for WASP-12b and retrieve an isothermal temperature and water abundance consistent with the literature. We highlight that our method is flexible and can be expanded to higher-resolution spectra and a larger number of atmospheric parameters. 

210__ Asymptotic Distributions and Rates of Convergence for Random Forests and  other Resampled Ensemble Learners__arXiv:1905.10651
Author: Wei Peng
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10651
 Abstract: Random forests remain among the most popular off-the-shelf supervised learning algorithms. Despite their well-documented empirical success, however, until recently, few theoretical results were available to describe their performance and behavior. In this work we push beyond recent work on consistency and asymptotic normality by establishing rates of convergence for random forests and other supervised learning ensembles. We develop the notion of generalized U-statistics and show that within this framework, random forest predictions remain asymptotically normal for larger subsample sizes than previously established. We also provide Berry-Esseen bounds in order to quantify the rate at which this convergence occurs, making explicit the roles of the subsample size and the number of trees in determining the distribution of random forest predictions.

 Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of assessing the variability of predictions from deep neural networks. There is a growing literature on using and improving the predictive accuracy of deep networks, but a concomitant improvement in the quantification of their uncertainty is lacking. We provide a prediction interval network (PI-Network) which is a transparent, tractable modification of the standard predictive loss used to train deep networks. The PI-Network outputs three values instead of a single point estimate and optimizes a loss function inspired by quantile regression. We go beyond merely motivating the construction of these networks and provide two prediction interval methods with provable, finite sample coverage guarantees without any assumptions on the underlying distribution from which our data is drawn. We only require that the observations are independent and identically distributed. Furthermore, our intervals adapt to heteroskedasticity and asymmetry in the conditional distribution of the response given the covariates. The first method leverages the conformal inference framework and provides average coverage. The second method provides a new, stronger guarantee by conditioning on the observed data. Lastly, our loss function does not compromise the predictive accuracy of the network like other prediction interval methods. We demonstrate the ease of use of the PI-Network as well as its improvements over other methods on both simulated and real data. As the PI-Network can be used with a host of deep learning methods with only minor modifications, its use should become standard practice, much like reporting standard errors along with mean estimates. 

212__ multilayer image  segmentation and synthesis__arXiv:1905.10629
Author: Jonathan Vacher
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10629
 Abstract: Finite mixture models for clustering can often be improved by adding a regularization that is specific to the topology of the data. For instance, mixtures are common in unsupervised image segmentation, and typically rely on averaging the posterior mixing probabilities of spatially adjacent data points (i.e. smoothing). However, this approach has had limited success with natural images. Here we make three contributions. First, we show that a Dirichlet prior with an appropriate choice of parameters allows -- using the Expectation-Maximization approach -- to define any linear update rule for the mixing probabilities, including many smoothing regularizations as special cases. Second, we demonstrate how to use this flexible design of the update rule to propagate segmentation information across layers of a deep network, and to train mixtures jointly across layers. Third, we compare the standard Gaussian mixture and the Student-t mixture, which is known to better capture the statistics of low-level visual features. We show that our models achieve competitive performance in natural image segmentation, with the Student-t mixtures reaching state-of-the art on boundaries scores. We also demonstrate how to exploit the resulting multilayer probabilistic generative model to synthesize naturalistic images beyond uniform textures. 

213__ Reconstructing faces from voices__arXiv:1905.10604
Author: Yandong Wen
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10604
 Abstract: Voice profiling aims at inferring various human parameters from their speech, e.g. gender, age, etc. In this paper, we address the challenge posed by a subtask of voice profiling - reconstructing someone's face from their voice. The task is designed to answer the question: given an audio clip spoken by an unseen person, can we picture a face that has as many common elements, or associations as possible with the speaker, in terms of identity? To address this problem, we propose a simple but effective computational framework based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). The network learns to generate faces from voices by matching the identities of generated faces to those of the speakers, on a training set. We evaluate the performance of the network by leveraging a closely related task - cross-modal matching. The results show that our model is able to generate faces that match several biometric characteristics of the speaker, and results in matching accuracies that are much better than chance. 

214__ Fast and Accurate Gaussian Kernel Ridge Regression Using Matrix  Decompositions for Preconditioning__arXiv:1905.10587
Author: Gil Shabat
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10587
 Abstract: This paper presents a method for building a preconditioner for a kernel ridge regression problem, where the preconditioner is not only effective in its ability to reduce the condition number substantially, but also efficient in its application in terms of computational cost and memory consumption. The suggested approach is based on randomized matrix decomposition methods, combined with the fast multipole method to achieve an algorithm that can process large datasets in complexity linear to the number of data points. In addition, a detailed theoretical analysis is provided, including an upper bound to the condition number. Finally, for Gaussian kernels, the analysis shows that the required rank for a desired condition number can be determined directly from the dataset itself without performing any analysis on the kernel matrix. 

215__ Deep Image Feature Learning with Fuzzy Rules__arXiv:1905.10575
Author: Xiang Ma
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10575
 Abstract: The methods of extracting image features are the key to many image processing tasks. At present, the most popular method is the deep neural network which can automatically extract robust features through end-to-end training instead of hand-crafted feature extraction. However, the deep neural network currently faces many challenges: 1) its effectiveness is heavily dependent on large datasets, so the computational complexity is very high; 2) it is usually regarded as a black box model with poor interpretability. To meet the above challenges, a more interpretable and scalable feature learning method, i.e., deep image feature learning with fuzzy rules (DIFL-FR), is proposed in the paper, which combines the rule-based fuzzy modeling technique and the deep stacked learning strategy. The method progressively learns image features through a layer-by-layer manner based on fuzzy rules, so the feature learning process can be better explained by the generated rules. More importantly, the learning process of the method is only based on forward propagation without back propagation and iterative learning, which results in the high learning efficiency. In addition, the method is under the settings of unsupervised learning and can be easily extended to scenes of supervised and semi-supervised learning. Extensive experiments are conducted on image datasets of different scales. The results obviously show the effectiveness of the proposed method. 

216__ Robust Unsupervised Flexible Auto-weighted Local-Coordinate Concept  Factorization for Image Clustering__arXiv:1905.10564
Author: Zhao Zhang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10564
 Abstract: We investigate the high-dimensional data clustering problem by proposing a novel and unsupervised representation learning model called Robust Flexible Auto-weighted Local-coordinate Concept Factorization (RFA-LCF). RFA-LCF integrates the robust flexible CF, robust sparse local-coordinate coding and the adaptive reconstruction weighting learning into a unified model. The adaptive weighting is driven by including the joint manifold preserving constraints on the recovered clean data, basis concepts and new representation. Specifically, our RFA-LCF uses a L2,1-norm based flexible residue to encode the mismatch between clean data and its reconstruction, and also applies the robust adaptive sparse local-coordinate coding to represent the data using a few nearby basis concepts, which can make the factorization more accurate and robust to noise. The robust flexible factorization is also performed in the recovered clean data space for enhancing representations. RFA-LCF also considers preserving the local manifold structures of clean data space, basis concept space and the new coordinate space jointly in an adaptive manner way. Extensive comparisons show that RFA-LCF can deliver enhanced clustering results. 

217__ Ensemble of 3D CNN regressors with data fusion for fluid intelligence  prediction__arXiv:1905.10550
Author: Marina Pominova
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10550
 Abstract: In this work, we aim at predicting children's fluid intelligence scores based on structural T1-weighted MR images from the largest long-term study of brain development and child health. The target variable was regressed on a data collection site, socio-demographic variables and brain volume, thus being independent to the potentially informative factors, which are not directly related to the brain functioning. We investigate both feature extraction and deep learning approaches as well as different deep CNN architectures and their ensembles. We propose an advanced architecture of VoxCNNs ensemble, which yield MSE (92.838) on blind test. 

218__ Circumventing Harmful Fairness__arXiv:1905.10546
Author: Omer Ben-Porat
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10546
 Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) algorithms shape our lives. Banks use them to determine if we are good borrowers; IT companies delegate them recruitment decisions; police apply ML for crime-prediction, and judges base their verdicts on ML. However, real-world examples show that such automated decisions tend to discriminate protected groups. This generated a huge hype both in media and in the research community. Quite a few formal notions of fairness were proposed, which take a form of constraints a ``fair'' algorithm must satisfy. We focus on scenarios where fairness is imposed on a self-interested party (e.g., a bank that maximizes its revenue). We find that the disadvantaged protected group can be worse off after imposing a fairness constraint. We introduce a family of Welfare-Equalizing fairness constraints that equalize per-capita welfare of protected groups, and include Demographic Parity and Equal Opportunity as particular cases. In this family, we characterize conditions under which the fairness constraint helps the disadvantaged group. We also characterize the structure of the optimal Welfare-Equalizing classifier for the self-interested party, and provide an LP-based algorithm to compute it. Overall, our Welfare-Equalizing fairness approach provides a unified framework for discussing fairness in classification in the presence of a self-interested party. 

219__ An Open-source Toolkit for Deep Learning based Recommendation__arXiv:1905.10536
Author: Shuai Zhang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10536
 Abstract: Deep learning based recommender systems have been extensively explored in recent years. However, the large number of models proposed each year poses a big challenge for both researchers and practitioners in reproducing the results for further comparisons. Although a portion of papers provides source code, they adopted different programming languages or different deep learning packages, which also raises the bar in grasping the ideas. To alleviate this problem, we released the open source project: \textbf{DeepRec}. In this toolkit, we have implemented a number of deep learning based recommendation algorithms using Python and the widely used deep learning package - Tensorflow. Three major recommendation scenarios: rating prediction, top-N recommendation (item ranking) and sequential recommendation, were considered. Meanwhile, DeepRec maintains good modularity and extensibility to easily incorporate new models into the framework. It is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License. The source code is available at github: \url{this https URL} 

220__ Generative Noise Learning for Blind Image Denoising with Single  Noisy Images__arXiv:1905.10488
Author: Sungmin Cha
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10488
 Abstract: We tackle a challenging blind image denoising problem, in which only single noisy images are available for training a denoiser and no information about noise is known, except for it being zero-mean, additive, and independent of the clean image. In such a setting, which often occurs in practice, it is not possible to train a denoiser with the standard discriminative training or with the recently developed Noise2Noise (N2N) training; the former requires the underlying clean image for the given noisy image, and the latter requires two independently realized noisy image pair for a clean image. To that end, we propose GAN2GAN (Generated-Artificial-Noise to Generated-Artificial-Noise) method that can first learn to generate synthetic noisy image pairs that simulate independent realizations of the noise in the given images, then carry out the N2N training of a denoiser with those synthetically generated noisy image pairs. Our method consists of three parts: extracting smooth noisy patches to learn the noise distribution in the given images, training a generative model to synthesize the noisy image pairs, and devising an iterative N2N training of a denoiser. In results, we show the denoiser trained with our GAN2GAN, solely based on single noisy images, achieves an impressive denoising performance, almost approaching the performance of the standard discriminatively-trained or N2N-trained models that have more information than ours, and significantly outperforming the recent baselines for the same setting. 

221__ A Framework for Non-adversarial Image Generation__arXiv:1905.10485
Author: Zhisheng Xiao
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10485
 Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been shown to outperform non-adversarial generative models in terms of the image generation quality by a large margin. Recently, researchers have looked into improving non-adversarial alternatives that can close the gap of generation quality while avoiding some common issues of GANs, such as unstable training and mode collapse. Examples in this direction include Two-stage VAE and Generative Latent Nearest Neighbors. However, a major drawback of these models is that they are slow to train, and in particular, they require two training stages. To address this, we propose Generative Latent Flow (GLF), which uses an auto-encoder to learn the mapping to and from the latent space, and an invertible flow to map the distribution in the latent space to simple i.i.d noise. The advantages of our method include a simple conceptual framework, single stage training and fast convergence. Quantitatively, the generation quality of our model significantly outperforms that of VAEs, and is competitive with GANs' benchmark on commonly used datasets. 

222__ Fully Hyperbolic Convolutional Neural Networks__arXiv:1905.10484
Author: Keegan Lensink
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10484
 Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have recently seen tremendous success in various computer vision tasks. However, their application to problems with high dimensional input and output has been limited by two factors. First, in the training stage, it is necessary to store network activations for back propagation. Second, in the inference stage, a few copies of the image are typically stored to be concatenated to other network states deeper in the network. In these settings, the memory requirements associated with storing activations can exceed what is feasible with current hardware. For the problem of image classification, reversible architectures have been proposed that allow one to recalculate activations in the backwards pass instead of storing them, however, such networks do not perform well for problems such as segmentation. Furthermore, currently only block reversible networks have been possible because pooling operations are not reversible. Motivated by the propagation of signals over physical networks, that are governed by the hyperbolic Telegraph equation, in this work we introduce a fully conservative hyperbolic network for problems with high dimensional input and output. We introduce a coarsening operation that allows completely reversible CNNs by using the Discrete Wavelet Transform and its inverse to both coarsen and interpolate the network state and change the number of channels. This means that during training we do not need to store the activations from the forward pass, and can train arbitrarily deep or wide networks. Furthermore, our network has a much lower memory footprint for inference. We show that we are able to achieve results comparable to the state of the art in image classification, depth estimation, and semantic segmentation, with a much lower memory footprint. 

223__ Efficiently Estimating Erdos-Renyi Graphs with Node Differential Privacy__arXiv:1905.10477
Author: Adam Sealfon
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10477
 Abstract: We give a simple, computationally efficient, and node-differentially-private algorithm for estimating the parameter of an Erdos-Renyi graph---that is, estimating p in a G(n,p)---with near-optimal accuracy. Our algorithm nearly matches the information-theoretically optimal exponential-time algorithm for the same problem due to Borgs et al. (FOCS 2018). More generally, we give an optimal, computationally efficient, private algorithm for estimating the edge-density of any graph whose degree distribution is concentrated on a small interval. 

224__ Decentralized Bayesian Learning over Graphs__arXiv:1905.10466
Author: Anusha Lalitha
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10466
 Abstract: We propose a decentralized learning algorithm over a general social network. The algorithm leaves the training data distributed on the mobile devices while utilizing a peer to peer model aggregation method. The proposed algorithm allows agents with local data to learn a shared model explaining the global training data in a decentralized fashion. The proposed algorithm can be viewed as a Bayesian and peer-to-peer variant of federated learning in which each agent keeps a "posterior probability distribution" over a global model parameters. The agent update its "posterior" based on 1) the local training data and 2) the asynchronous communication and model aggregation with their 1-hop neighbors. This Bayesian formulation allows for a systematic treatment of model aggregation over any arbitrary connected graph. Furthermore, it provides strong analytic guarantees on converge in the realizable case as well as a closed form characterization of the rate of convergence. We also show that our methodology can be combined with efficient Bayesian inference techniques to train Bayesian neural networks in a decentralized manner. By empirical studies we show that our theoretical analysis can guide the design of network/social interactions and data partitioning to achieve convergence. 

225__ Geometric Wavelet Scattering Networks on Compact Riemannian Manifolds__arXiv:1905.10448
Author: Michael Perlmutter
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10448
 Abstract: The Euclidean scattering transform was introduced nearly a decade ago to improve the mathematical understanding of convolutional neural networks. Inspired by recent interest in geometric deep learning, which aims to generalize convolutional neural networks to manifold and graph-structured domains, we define a geometric scattering transform on manifolds. Similar to the Euclidean scattering transform, the geometric scattering transform is based on a cascade of wavelet filters and pointwise nonlinearities. It is invariant to local isometries and stable to certain types of diffeomorphisms. Empirical results demonstrate its utility on several geometric learning tasks. Our results generalize the deformation stability and local translation invariance of Euclidean scattering, and demonstrate the importance of linking the used filter structures to the underlying geometry of the data. 

226__ Domain Invariant Variational Autoencoders__arXiv:1905.10427
Author: Maximilian Ilse
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10427
 Abstract: We consider the problem of domain generalization, namely, how to learn representations given data from a set of domains that generalize to data from a previously unseen domain. We propose the Domain Invariant Variational Autoencoder (DIVA), a generative model that tackles this problem by learning three independent latent subspaces, one for the domain, one for the class, and one for any residual variations. We highlight that due to the generative nature of our model we can also incorporate unlabeled data from known or previously unseen domains. To the best of our knowledge this has not been done before in a domain generalization setting. This property is highly desirable in fields like medical imaging where labeled data is scarce. We experimentally evaluate our model on the rotated MNIST benchmark and a malaria cell images dataset where we show that (i) the learned subspaces are indeed complementary to each other, (ii) we improve upon recent works on this task and (iii) incorporating unlabelled data can boost the performance even further. 

227__ A general method for regularizing tensor decomposition methods via  pseudo-data__arXiv:1905.10424
Author: Omer Gottesman
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10424
 Abstract: Tensor decomposition methods allow us to learn the parameters of latent variable models through decomposition of low-order moments of data. A significant limitation of these algorithms is that there exists no general method to regularize them, and in the past regularization has mostly been performed using bespoke modifications to the algorithms, tailored for the particular form of the desired regularizer. We present a general method of regularizing tensor decomposition methods which can be used for any likelihood model that is learnable using tensor decomposition methods and any differentiable regularization function by supplementing the training data with pseudo-data. The pseudo-data is optimized to balance two terms: being as close as possible to the true data and enforcing the desired regularization. On synthetic, semi-synthetic and real data, we demonstrate that our method can improve inference accuracy and regularize for a broad range of goals including transfer learning, sparsity, interpretability, and orthogonality of the learned parameters. 

228__ Emotion Classification in Response to Tactile Enhanced Multimedia using  Frequency Domain Features of Brain Signals__arXiv:1905.10423
Author: Aasim Raheel
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10423
 Abstract: Tactile enhanced multimedia is generated by synchronizing traditional multimedia clips, to generate hot and cold air effect, with an electric heater and a fan. This objective is to give viewers a more realistic and immersing feel of the multimedia content. The response to this enhanced multimedia content (mulsemedia) is evaluated in terms of the appreciation/emotion by using human brain signals. We observe and record electroencephalography (EEG) data using a commercially available four channel MUSE headband. A total of 21 participants voluntarily participated in this study for EEG recordings. We extract frequency domain features from five different bands of each EEG channel. Four emotions namely: happy, relaxed, sad, and angry are classified using a support vector machine in response to the tactile enhanced multimedia. An increased accuracy of 76:19% is achieved when compared to 63:41% by using the time domain features. Our results show that the selected frequency domain features could be better suited for emotion classification in mulsemedia studies. 

229__ A  Novel Graph Neural Network Approach__arXiv:1905.10418
Author: Changjun Fan
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10418
 Abstract: Betweenness centrality (BC) is one of the most used centrality measures for network analysis, which seeks to describe the importance of nodes in a network in terms of the fraction of shortest paths that pass through them. It is key to many valuable applications, including community detection and network dismantling. Computing BC scores on large networks is computationally challenging due to high time complexity. Many approximation algorithms have been proposed to speed up the estimation of BC, which are mainly sampling-based. However, these methods are still prone to considerable execution time on large-scale networks, and their results are often exacerbated when small changes happen to the network structures. In this paper, we focus on identifying nodes with high BC in a graph, since many application scenarios are built upon retrieving nodes with top-k BC. Different from previous heuristic methods, we turn this task into a learning problem and design an encoder-decoder based framework to resolve the problem. More specifcally, the encoder leverages the network structure to encode each node into an embedding vector, which captures the important structural information of the node. The decoder transforms the embedding vector for each node into a scalar, which captures the relative rank of this node in terms of BC. We use the pairwise ranking loss to train the model to identify the orders of nodes regarding their BC. By training on small-scale networks, the learned model is capable of assigning relative BC scores to nodes for any unseen networks, and thus identifying the highly-ranked nodes. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate that, compared to representative baselines, our model drastically speeds up the prediction without noticeable sacrifce in accuracy, and outperforms the state-of-the-art by accuracy on several large real-world networks. 

230__ Using Deep Networks and Transfer Learning to Address Disinformation__arXiv:1905.10412
Author: Numa Dhamani
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10412
 Abstract: We apply an ensemble pipeline composed of a character-level convolutional neural network (CNN) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) as a general tool for addressing a range of disinformation problems. We also demonstrate the ability to use this architecture to transfer knowledge from labeled data in one domain to related (supervised and unsupervised) tasks. Character-level neural networks and transfer learning are particularly valuable tools in the disinformation space because of the messy nature of social media, lack of labeled data, and the multi-channel tactics of influence campaigns. We demonstrate their effectiveness in several tasks relevant for detecting disinformation: spam emails, review bombing, political sentiment, and conversation clustering. 

231__ Fast computation of loudness using a deep neural network__arXiv:1905.10399
Author: Josef Schlittenlacher
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10399
 Abstract: The present paper introduces a deep neural network (DNN) for predicting the instantaneous loudness of a sound from its time waveform. The DNN was trained using the output of a more complex model, called the Cambridge loudness model. While a modern PC can perform a few hundred loudness computations per second using the Cambridge loudness model, it can perform more than 100,000 per second using the DNN, allowing real-time calculation of loudness. The root-mean-square deviation between the predictions of instantaneous loudness level using the two models was less than 0.5 phon for unseen types of sound. We think that the general approach of simulating a complex perceptual model by a much faster DNN can be applied to other perceptual models to make them run in real time. 

232__ Structure-preserving Method for Reconstructing Unknown Hamiltonian  Systems from Trajectory Data__arXiv:1905.10396
Author: Kailiang Wu
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10396
 Abstract: We present a numerical approach for approximating unknown Hamiltonian systems using observation data. A distinct feature of the proposed method is that it is structure-preserving, in the sense that it enforces conservation of the reconstructed Hamiltonian. This is achieved by directly approximating the underlying unknown Hamiltonian, rather than the right-hand-side of the governing equations. We present the technical details of the proposed algorithm and its error estimate, along with a practical de-noising procedure to cope with noisy data. A set of numerical examples are then presented to demonstrate the structure-preserving property and effectiveness of the algorithm. 

233__ A Generalization Error Bound for Multi-class Domain Generalization__arXiv:1905.10392
Author: Aniket Anand Deshmukh
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10392
 Abstract: Domain generalization is the problem of assigning labels to an unlabeled data set, given several similar data sets for which labels have been provided. Despite considerable interest in this problem over the last decade, there has been no theoretical analysis in the setting of multi-class classification. In this work, we study a kernel-based learning algorithm and establish a generalization error bound that scales logarithmically in the number of classes, matching state-of-the-art bounds for multi-class classification in the conventional learning setting. We also demonstrate empirically that the proposed algorithm achieves significant performance gains compared to a pooling strategy. 

234__ A Compression Objective and a Cycle Loss for Neural Image Compression__arXiv:1905.10371
Author: Caglar Aytekin
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10371
 Abstract: In this manuscript we propose two objective terms for neural image compression: a compression objective and a cycle loss. These terms are applied on the encoder output of an autoencoder and are used in combination with reconstruction losses. The compression objective encourages sparsity and low entropy in the activations. The cycle loss term represents the distortion between encoder outputs computed from the original image and from the reconstructed image (code-domain distortion). We train different autoencoders by using the compression objective in combination with different losses: a) MSE, b) MSE and MSSSIM, c) MSE, MS-SSIM and cycle loss. We observe that images encoded by these differently-trained autoencoders fall into different points of the perception-distortion curve (while having similar bit-rates). In particular, MSE-only training favors low image-domain distortion, whereas cycle loss training favors high perceptual quality. 

235__ User-Device Authentication in Mobile Banking using APHEN for Paratuck2  Tensor Decomposition__arXiv:1905.10363
Author: Jeremy Charlier
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10363
 Abstract: The new financial European regulations such as PSD2 are changing the retail banking services. Noticeably, the monitoring of the personal expenses is now opened to other institutions than retail banks. Nonetheless, the retail banks are looking to leverage the user-device authentication on the mobile banking applications to enhance the personal financial advertisement. To address the profiling of the authentication, we rely on tensor decomposition, a higher dimensional analogue of matrix decomposition. We use Paratuck2, which expresses a tensor as a multiplication of matrices and diagonal tensors, because of the imbalance between the number of users and devices. We highlight why Paratuck2 is more appropriate in this case than the popular CP tensor decomposition, which decomposes a tensor as a sum of rank-one tensors. However, the computation of Paratuck2 is computational intensive. We propose a new APproximate HEssian-based Newton resolution algorithm, APHEN, capable of solving Paratuck2 more accurately and faster than the other popular approaches based on alternating least square or gradient descent. The results of Paratuck2 are used for the predictions of users' authentication with neural networks. We apply our method for the concrete case of targeting clients for financial advertising campaigns based on the authentication events generated by mobile banking applications. 

236__ Multi-Sample Dropout for Accelerated Training and Better Generalization__arXiv:1905.09788
Author: Hiroshi Inoue
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09788
 Abstract: Dropout is a simple but efficient regularization technique for achieving better generalization of deep neural networks (DNNs); hence it is widely used in tasks based on DNNs. During training, dropout randomly discards a portion of the neurons to avoid overfitting. This paper presents an enhanced dropout technique, which we call multi-sample dropout, for both accelerating training and improving generalization over the original dropout. The original dropout creates a randomly selected subset (called a dropout sample) from the input in each training iteration while the multi-sample dropout creates multiple dropout samples. The loss is calculated for each sample, and then the sample losses are averaged to obtain the final loss. This technique can be easily implemented without implementing a new operator by duplicating a part of the network after the dropout layer while sharing the weights among the duplicated fully connected layers. Experimental results showed that multi-sample dropout significantly accelerates training by reducing the number of iterations until convergence for image classification tasks using the ImageNet, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets. Multi-sample dropout does not significantly increase computation cost per iteration because most of the computation time is consumed in the convolution layers before the dropout layer, which are not duplicated. Experiments also showed that networks trained using multi-sample dropout achieved lower error rates and losses for both the training set and validation set. 

237__ Sampling Clustering__arXiv:1806.08245
Author: Ching Tarn
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08245
 Abstract: We propose an efficient linear-time graph-based divisive cluster analysis approach called Sampling Clustering. It constructs a lite informative dendrogram by recursively dividing a graph into subgraphs. In each recursive call, a graph is sampled first with a set of vertices being removed to disconnect latent clusters, then condensed by adding edges to the remaining vertices to avoid graph fragmentation caused by vertex removals. We also present some sampling and condensing methods and discuss the effectiveness in this paper. Our implementations run in linear time and achieve outstanding performance on various types of datasets. Experimental results show that they outperform state-of-the-art clustering algorithms with significantly less computing resource requirements.
