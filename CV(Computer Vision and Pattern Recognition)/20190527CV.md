001__ Deep Trajectory for Recognition of Human Behaviours__arXiv:1905.10357
Author: Tauseef Ali
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10357
 Abstract: Identifying human actions in complex scenes is widely considered as a challenging research problem due to the unpredictable behaviors and variation of appearances and postures. For extracting variations in motion and postures, trajectories provide meaningful way. However, simple trajectories are normally represented by vector of spatial coordinates. In order to identify human actions, we must exploit structural relationship between different trajectories. In this paper, we propose a method that divides the video into N number of segments and then for each segment we extract trajectories. We then compute trajectory descriptor for each segment which capture the structural relationship among different trajectories in the video segment. For trajectory descriptor, we project all extracted trajectories on the canvas. This will result in texture image which can store the relative motion and structural relationship among the trajectories. We then train Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to capture and learn the representation from dense trajectories. . Experimental results shows that our proposed method out performs state of the art methods by 90.01% on benchmark data set. 

002__ Mask-Guided Portrait Editing with Conditional GANs__arXiv:1905.10346
Author: Shuyang Gu
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10346
 Abstract: Portrait editing is a popular subject in photo manipulation. The Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) advances the generating of realistic faces and allows more face editing. In this paper, we argue about three issues in existing techniques: diversity, quality, and controllability for portrait synthesis and editing. To address these issues, we propose a novel end-to-end learning framework that leverages conditional GANs guided by provided face masks for generating faces. The framework learns feature embeddings for every face component (e.g., mouth, hair, eye), separately, contributing to better correspondences for image translation, and local face editing. With the mask, our network is available to many applications, like face synthesis driven by mask, face Swap+ (including hair in swapping), and local manipulation. It can also boost the performance of face parsing a bit as an option of data augmentation. 

003__ Uncertainty Estimation in One-Stage Object Detection__arXiv:1905.10296
Author: Florian Kraus
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10296
 Abstract: Environment perception is the task for intelligent vehicles on which all subsequent steps rely. A key part of perception is to safely detect other road users such as vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists. With modern deep learning techniques huge progress was made over the last years in this field. However such deep learning based object detection models cannot predict how certain they are in their predictions, potentially hampering the performance of later steps such as tracking or sensor fusion. We present a viable approaches to estimate uncertainty in an one-stage object detector, while improving the detection performance of the baseline approach. The proposed model is evaluated on a large scale automotive pedestrian dataset. Experimental results show that the uncertainty outputted by our system is coupled with detection accuracy and the occlusion level of pedestrians. 

004__ Deep Mesh Autoencoders for Non-Rigidly Deforming Objects__arXiv:1905.10290
Author: Edgar Tretschk
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10290
 Abstract: Mesh autoencoders are commonly used for dimensionality reduction, sampling and mesh modeling. We propose a general-purpose DEep MEsh Autoencoder (DEMEA) which adds a novel embedded deformation layer to a graph-convolutional mesh autoencoder. The embedded deformation layer (EDL) is a differentiable deformable geometric proxy which explicitly models point displacements of non-rigid deformations in a lower dimensional space and serves as a local rigidity regularizer. DEMEA decouples the parameterization of the deformation from the final mesh resolution since the deformation is defined over a lower dimensional embedded deformation graph. We perform a large-scale study on four different datasets of deformable objects. Reasoning about the local rigidity of meshes using EDL allows us to achieve higher-quality results for highly deformable objects, compared to directly regressing vertex positions. We demonstrate multiple applications of DEMEA, including non-rigid 3D reconstruction from depth and shading cues, non-rigid surface tracking, as well as the transfer of deformations over different meshes. 

005__ Semantic mesh generation using relative attributes__arXiv:1905.10257
Author: Yassir Saquil
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10257
 Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a novel problem of using generative adversarial networks in the task of 3D shape generation according to semantic attributes. Recent works map 3D shapes into 2D parameter domain, which enables training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for 3D shape generation task. We extend these architectures to the conditional setting, where we generate 3D shapes with respect to subjective attributes defined by the user. Given pairwise comparisons of 3D shapes, our model performs two tasks: it learns a generative model with a controlled latent space, and a ranking function for the 3D shapes based on their multi-chart representation in 2D. The capability of the model is demonstrated with experiments on HumanShape, Basel Face Model and reconstructed 3D CUB datasets. We also present various applications that benefit from our model, such as multi-attribute exploration, mesh editing, and mesh attribute transfer. 

006__ Video Inbetweening Using Direct 3D Convolutions__arXiv:1905.10240
Author: Yunpeng Li
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10240
 Abstract: We consider the problem of generating plausible and diverse video sequences, when we are only given a start and an end frame. This task is also known as inbetweening, and it belongs to the broader area of stochastic video generation, which is generally approached by means of recurrent neural networks (RNN). In this paper, we propose instead a fully convolutional model to generate video sequences directly in the pixel domain. We first obtain a latent video representation using a stochastic fusion mechanism that learns how to incorporate information from the start and end frames. Our model learns to produce such latent representation by progressively increasing the temporal resolution, and then decode in the spatiotemporal domain using 3D convolutions. The model is trained end-to-end by minimizing an adversarial loss. Experiments on several widely-used benchmark datasets show that it is able to generate meaningful and diverse in-between video sequences, according to both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. 

007__ A Comparison and Strategy of Semantic Segmentation on Remote Sensing  Images__arXiv:1905.10231
Author: Junxing Hu
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10231
 Abstract: In recent years, with the development of aerospace technology, we use more and more images captured by satellites to obtain information. But a large number of useless raw images, limited data storage resource and poor transmission capability on satellites hinder our use of valuable images. Therefore, it is necessary to deploy an on-orbit semantic segmentation model to filter out useless images before data transmission. In this paper, we present a detailed comparison on the recent deep learning models. Considering the computing environment of satellites, we compare methods from accuracy, parameters and resource consumption on the same public dataset. And we also analyze the relation between them. Based on experimental results, we further propose a viable on-orbit semantic segmentation strategy. It will be deployed on the TianZhi-2 satellite which supports deep learning methods and will be lunched soon. 

008__ A Strong Baseline for Real-World Visual Reasoning__arXiv:1905.10226
Author: Chenfei Wu
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10226
 Abstract: This paper presents a strong baseline for real-world visual reasoning (GQA), which achieves 60.93% in GQA 2019 challenge and won the sixth place. GQA is a large dataset with 22M questions involving spatial understanding and multi-step inference. To help further research in this area, we identified three crucial parts that improve the performance, namely: multi-source features, fine-grained encoder, and score-weighted ensemble. We provide a series of analysis on their impact on performance. 

009__ Generative Flow via Invertible nxn Convolution__arXiv:1905.10170
Author: Thanh-Dat Truong
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10170
 Abstract: Flow-based generative models have recently become one of the most efficient approaches to model the data generation. Indeed, they are constructed with a sequence of invertible and tractable transformations. Glow first introduced a simple type of generative flow using an invertible 1x1 convolution. However, the 1x1 convolution suffers from limited flexibility compared to the standard convolutions. In this paper, we propose a novel invertible nxn convolution approach that overcomes the limitations of the invertible 1x1 convolution. In addition, our proposed network is not only tractable and invertible but also uses fewer parameters than standard convolutions. The experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and Celeb-HQ datasets, have showed that our invertible nxn convolution helps to improve the performance of generative models significantly. 

010__ Saliency detection based on structural dissimilarity induced by image  quality assessment model__arXiv:1905.10150
Author: Yang Li
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10150
 Abstract: The distinctiveness of image regions is widely used as the cue of saliency. Generally, the distinctiveness is computed according to the absolute difference of features. However, according to the image quality assessment (IQA) studies, the human visual system is highly sensitive to structural changes rather than absolute difference. Accordingly, we propose the computation of the structural dissimilarity between image patches as the distinctiveness measure for saliency detection. Similar to IQA models, the structural dissimilarity is computed based on the correlation of the structural features. The global structural dissimilarity of a patch to all the other patches represents saliency of the patch. We adopt two widely used structural features, namely the local contrast and gradient magnitude, into the structural dissimilarity computation in the proposed model. Without any postprocessing, the proposed model based on the correlation of either of the two structural features outperforms 11 state-of-the-art saliency models on three saliency databases. 

011__ Robust Semantic Segmentation in Adverse Weather Conditions by means of  Sensor Data Fusion__arXiv:1905.10117
Author: Andreas Pfeuffer
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10117
 Abstract: A robust and reliable semantic segmentation in adverse weather conditions is very important for autonomous cars, but most state-of-the-art approaches only achieve high accuracy rates in optimal weather conditions. The reason is that they are only optimized for good weather conditions and given noise models. However, most of them fail, if data with unknown disturbances occur, and their performance decrease enormously. One possibility to still obtain reliable results is to observe the environment with different sensor types, such as camera and lidar, and to fuse the sensor data by means of neural networks, since different sensors behave differently in diverse weather conditions. Hence, the sensors can complement each other by means of an appropriate sensor data fusion. Nevertheless, the fusion-based approaches are still susceptible to disturbances and fail to classify disturbed image areas correctly. This problem can be solved by means of a special training method, the so called Robust Learning Method (RLM), a method by which the neural network learns to handle unknown noise. In this work, two different sensor fusion architectures for semantic segmentation are compared and evaluated on several datasets. Furthermore, it is shown that the RLM increases the robustness in adverse weather conditions enormously, and achieve good results although no disturbance model has been learned by the neural network. 

012__ Guided Stereo Matching__arXiv:1905.10107
Author: Matteo Poggi
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10107
 Abstract: Stereo is a prominent technique to infer dense depth maps from images, and deep learning further pushed forward the state-of-the-art, making end-to-end architectures unrivaled when enough data is available for training. However, deep networks suffer from significant drops in accuracy when dealing with new environments. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce Guided Stereo Matching, a novel paradigm leveraging a small amount of sparse, yet reliable depth measurements retrieved from an external source enabling to ameliorate this weakness. The additional sparse cues required by our method can be obtained with any strategy (e.g., a LiDAR) and used to enhance features linked to corresponding disparity hypotheses. Our formulation is general and fully differentiable, thus enabling to exploit the additional sparse inputs in pre-trained deep stereo networks as well as for training a new instance from scratch. Extensive experiments on three standard datasets and two state-of-the-art deep architectures show that even with a small set of sparse input cues, i) the proposed paradigm enables significant improvements to pre-trained networks. Moreover, ii) training from scratch notably increases accuracy and robustness to domain shifts. Finally, iii) it is suited and effective even with traditional stereo algorithms such as SGM. 

013__ Multi-Scale Dual-Branch Fully Convolutional Network for Hand Parsing__arXiv:1905.10100
Author: Yang Lu
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10100
 Abstract: Recently, fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) have shown significant performance in image parsing, including scene parsing and object parsing. Different from generic object parsing tasks, hand parsing is more challenging due to small size, complex structure, heavy self-occlusion and ambiguous texture problems. In this paper, we propose a novel parsing framework, Multi-Scale Dual-Branch Fully Convolutional Network (MSDB-FCN), for hand parsing tasks. Our network employs a Dual-Branch architecture to extract features of hand area, paying attention on the hand itself. These features are used to generate multi-scale features with pyramid pooling strategy. In order to better encode multi-scale features, we design a Deconvolution and Bilinear Interpolation Block (DB-Block) for upsampling and merging the features of different scales. To address data imbalance, which is a common problem in many computer vision tasks as well as hand parsing tasks, we propose a generalization of Focal Loss, namely Multi-Class Balanced Focal Loss, to tackle data imbalance in multi-class classification. Extensive experiments on RHD-PARSING dataset demonstrate that our MSDB-FCN has achieved the state-of-the-art performance for hand parsing. 

014__ Attention Based Network to Exploit Complementary Features for  RGBD Semantic Segmentation__arXiv:1905.10089
Author: Xinxin Hu
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10089
 Abstract: Compared to RGB semantic segmentation, RGBD semantic segmentation can achieve better performance by taking depth information into consideration. However, it is still problematic for contemporary segmenters to effectively exploit RGBD information since the feature distributions of RGB and depth (D) images vary significantly in different scenes. In this paper, we propose an Attention Complementary Network (ACNet) that selectively gathers features from RGB and depth branches. The main contributions lie in the Attention Complementary Module (ACM) and the architecture with three parallel branches. More precisely, ACM is a channel attention-based module that extracts weighted features from RGB and depth branches. The architecture preserves the inference of the original RGB and depth branches, and enables the fusion branch at the same time. Based on the above structures, ACNet is capable of exploiting more high-quality features from different channels. We evaluate our model on SUN-RGBD and NYUDv2 datasets, and prove that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In particular, a mIoU score of 48.3\% on NYUDv2 test set is achieved with ResNet50. We will release our source code based on PyTorch and the trained segmentation model at this https URL 

015__ Perspective Crowd Counting via Spatial Convolutional Network__arXiv:1905.10085
Author: Junyu Gao
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10085
 Abstract: Crowd counting from a single image is a challenging task due to high appearance similarity, perspective changes and severe congestion. Many methods only focus on the local appearance features and they cannot handle the aforementioned challenges. In order to tackle them, we propose a Perspective Crowd Counting Network (PCC Net), which consists of three parts: 1) Density Map Estimation (DME) focuses on learning very local features for density map estimation; 2) Random High-level Density Classification (R-HDC) extracts global features to predict the coarse density labels of random patches in images; 3) Fore-/Background Segmentation (FBS) encodes mid-level features to segments the foreground and background. Besides, the DULR module is embedded in PCC Net to encode the perspective changes on four directions (Down, Up, Left and Right). The proposed PCC Net is verified on five mainstream datasets, which achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the one and attains the competitive results on the other four datasets. The source code is available at this https URL 

016__ Towards One-Pass Real-Time Video Object Segmentation__arXiv:1905.10064
Author: Peng Sun
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10064
 Abstract: Video object segmentation aims at accurately segmenting the target object regions across consecutive frames. It is technically challenging for coping with complicated factors (e.g., shape deformations, occlusion and out of the lens). Recent approaches have largely solved them by using backforth re-identification and bi-directional mask propagation. However, their methods are extremely slow and only support offline inference, which in principle cannot be applied in real time. Motivated by this observation, we propose a new detection-based paradigm for video object segmentation. We propose an unified One-Pass Video Segmentation framework (OVS-Net) for modeling spatial-temporal representation in an end-to-end pipeline, which seamlessly integrates object detection, object segmentation, and object re-identification. The proposed framework lends itself to one-pass inference that effectively and efficiently performs video object segmentation. Moreover, we propose a mask guided attention module for modeling the multi-scale object boundary and multi-level feature fusion. Experiments on the challenging DAVIS 2017 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework with comparable performance to the state-of-the-art, and the great efficiency about 11.5 fps towards pioneering real-time work to our knowledge, more than 5 times faster than other state-of-the-art methods. 

017__ Pose-adaptive Hierarchical Attention Network for Facial Expression  Recognition__arXiv:1905.10059
Author: Yuanyuan Liu
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10059
 Abstract: Multi-view facial expression recognition (FER) is a challenging task because the appearance of an expression varies in poses. To alleviate the influences of poses, recent methods either perform pose normalization or learn separate FER classifiers for each pose. However, these methods usually have two stages and rely on good performance of pose estimators. Different from existing methods, we propose a pose-adaptive hierarchical attention network (PhaNet) that can jointly recognize the facial expressions and poses in unconstrained environment. Specifically, PhaNet discovers the most relevant regions to the facial expression by an attention mechanism in hierarchical scales, and the most informative scales are then selected to learn the pose-invariant and expression-discriminative representations. PhaNet is end-to-end trainable by minimizing the hierarchical attention losses, the FER loss and pose loss with dynamically learned loss weights. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed PhaNet on three multi-view datasets (BU-3DFE, Multi-pie, and KDEF) and two in-the-wild FER datasets (AffectNet and SFEW). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-arts under both within-dataset and cross-dataset settings, achieving the average accuracies of 84.92\%, 93.53\%, 88.5\%, 54.82\% and 31.25\% respectively. 

018__ A Compressive Sensing Video dataset using Pixel-wise coded exposure__arXiv:1905.10054
Author: Sathyaprakash Narayanan
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10054
 Abstract: Manifold amount of video data gets generated every minute as we read this document, ranging from surveillance to broadcasting purposes. There are two roadblocks that restrain us from using this data as such, first being the storage which restricts us from only storing the information based on the hardware constraints. Secondly, the computation required to process this data is highly expensive which makes it infeasible to work on them. Compressive sensing(CS)[2] is a signal process technique[11], through optimization, the sparsity of a signal can be exploited to recover it from far fewer samples than required by the Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem. There are two conditions under which recovery is possible. The first one is sparsity which requires the signal to be sparse in some domain. The second one is incoherence which is applied through the isometric property which is sufficient for sparse signals[9][10]. To sustain these characteristics, preserving all attributes in the uncompressed domain would help any kind of in this field. However, existing dataset fallback in terms of continuous tracking of all the object present in the scene, very few video datasets have comprehensive continuous tracking of objects. To address these problems collectively, in this work we propose a new comprehensive video dataset, where the data is compressed using pixel-wise coded exposure [3] that resolves various other impediments. 

019__ A Comprehensive Survey of  Heterogeneous Person Re-identification__arXiv:1905.10048
Author: Zheng Wang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10048
 Abstract: An effective and efficient person re-identification (ReID) algorithm will alleviate painful video watching, and accelerate the investigation progress. Recently, with the explosive requirements of practical applications, a lot of research efforts have been dedicated to heterogeneous person re-identification (He-ReID). In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art methods comprehensively with respect to four main application scenarios -- low-resolution, infrared, sketch and text. We begin with a comparison between He-ReID and the general Homogeneous ReID (Ho-ReID) task. Then, we survey the models that have been widely employed in He-ReID. Available existing datasets for performing evaluation are briefly described. We then summarize and compare the representative approaches. Finally, we discuss some future research directions. 

020__ Brain-mediated Transfer Learning of Convolutional Neural Networks__arXiv:1905.10037
Author: Satoshi Nishida
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10037
 Abstract: Human flexible cognition and behavior indicate that the human brain can effectively use its internal feature representations acquired through limited experiences for new experiences in different domains. This function is analogous to transfer learning (TL) in the field of machine learning. TL uses a well-trained feature space in a specific task domain to improve performance in new tasks with insufficient training data. TL with rich feature representations, such as features of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), shows high generalization ability across different task domains. However, such TL is still insufficient in making machine learning attain generalization ability comparable to that of the human brain. To address this, we introduce a method for TL mediated by human brains to improve the performance of TL especially on pattern recognition in which human high-level cognition is considered. Our method transforms feature representations of audiovisual inputs in CNNs into those in activation patterns of individual brains via their association learned ahead using measured brain responses. Then, to estimate labels reflecting human cognition and behavior induced by the audiovisual inputs, the transformed representations are used for TL. We demonstrate that our brain-mediated TL (BTL) shows higher performance in the label estimation than the standard TL. In addition, we illustrate that the estimations mediated by different brains vary from brain to brain, and the variability reflects the individual variability in perception. Thus, our BTL provides a framework to improve the generalization ability of machine-learning feature representations and enable machine learning to estimate human-like cognition and behavior, including individual variability. 

021__ Light-Weight RetinaNet for Object Detection__arXiv:1905.10011
Author: Yixing Li
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10011
 Abstract: Object detection has gained great progress driven by the development of deep learning. Compared with a widely studied task -- classification, generally speaking, object detection even need one or two orders of magnitude more FLOPs (floating point operations) in processing the inference task. To enable a practical application, it is essential to explore effective runtime and accuracy trade-off scheme. Recently, a growing number of studies are intended for object detection on resource constraint devices, such as YOLOv1, YOLOv2, SSD, MobileNetv2-SSDLite, whose accuracy on COCO test-dev detection results are yield to mAP around 22-25% (mAP-20-tier). On the contrary, very few studies discuss the computation and accuracy trade-off scheme for mAP-30-tier detection networks. In this paper, we illustrate the insights of why RetinaNet gives effective computation and accuracy trade-off for object detection and how to build a light-weight RetinaNet. We propose to only reduce FLOPs in computational intensive layers and keep other layer the same. Compared with most common way -- input image scaling for FLOPs-accuracy trade-off, the proposed solution shows a constantly better FLOPs-mAP trade-off line. Quantitatively, the proposed method result in 0.1% mAP improvement at 1.15x FLOPs reduction and 0.3% mAP improvement at 1.8x FLOPs reduction. 

022__ Implicit Label Augmentation on Partially Annotated Clips via  Temporally-Adaptive Features Learning__arXiv:1905.10000
Author: Yongxi Lu
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10000
 Abstract: Partially annotated clips contain rich temporal contexts that can complement the sparse key frame annotations in providing supervision for model training. We present a novel paradigm called Temporally-Adaptive Features (TAF) learning that can utilize such data to learn better single frame models. By imposing distinct temporal change rate constraints on different factors in the model, TAF enables learning from unlabeled frames using context to enhance model accuracy. TAF generalizes "slow feature" learning and we present much stronger empirical evidence than prior works, showing convincing gains for the challenging semantic segmentation task over a variety of architecture designs and on two popular datasets. TAF can be interpreted as an implicit label augmentation method but is a more principled formulation compared to existing explicit augmentation techniques. Our work thus connects two promising methods that utilize partially annotated clips for single frame model training and can inspire future explorations in this direction. 

023__ Self-Critical Reasoning for Robust Visual Question Answering__arXiv:1905.09998
Author: Jialin Wu
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09998
 Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) deep-learning systems tend to capture superficial statistical correlations in the training data because of strong language priors and fail to generalize to test data with a significantly different question-answer (QA) distribution. To address this issue, we introduce a self-critical training objective that ensures that visual explanations of correct answers match the most influential image regions more than other competitive answer candidates. The influential regions are either determined from human visual/textual explanations or automatically from just significant words in the question and answer. We evaluate our approach on the VQA generalization task using the VQA-CP dataset, achieving a new state-of-the-art i.e. 49.5\% using textual explanations and 48.5\% using automatically annotated regions. 

024__ A Real-Time Tiny Detection Model for Stem End and Blossom End of Navel  Orange__arXiv:1905.09994
Author: Xiaoye Sun
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09994
 Abstract: To distinguish the stem end and blossom end of navel orange from its black spot, we propose a real-time tiny detection model (RTTD) with low computational cost, compact architecture and high detection accuracy. In particular, based on the characteristics of the data, we apply pure dense connectivity to limit and simplify the design of the model architecture and use k-means clustering to set the size and aspect ratios of the default boxes. The architecture of model is based on deeply supervised object detectors (DSOD), and which reduces some components like dense block and prediction layers for efficient and adds some auxiliary structure like Squeeze-and-Excitation layer and Swish for accuracy. And we create a dataset in Pascal VOC format annotated the three types of detection targets stem end, blossom end and black spot. Experimental results on our orange data set confirm that RTTD has competitive results to the state-of-the-art one stage detectors like SSD, DSOD, YOLOv2, YOLOv3, RFB and FSSD, and it achieves 87.479%mAP at 131 FPS with only 5.812M parameters. 

025__ End-to-End Optimization of Multi-headed Models__arXiv:1905.09979
Author: Hanhan Li
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09979
 Abstract: Ensembling is a universally useful approach to boost the performance of machine learning models. However, individual models in an ensemble are typically trained independently in separate stages, without information access about the overall ensemble. In this paper, model ensembles are treated as first-class citizens, and their performance is optimized end-to-end with parameter sharing and a novel loss structure that improves generalization. On large-scale datasets including ImageNet, Youtube-8M, and Kinetics, we demonstrate a procedure that starts from a strongly performing single deep neural network, and constructs an EnsembleNet that has both a smaller size and better performance. Moreover, an EnsembleNet can be trained in one stage just like a single model without manual intervention. 

026__ Deep Monocular 3D Object Detection with Closed-Form  Geometric Constraints__arXiv:1905.09970
Author: Andretti Naiden
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09970
 Abstract: We propose Shift R-CNN, a hybrid model for monocular 3D object detection, which combines deep learning with the power of geometry. We adapt a Faster R-CNN network for regressing initial 2D and 3D object properties and combine it with a least squares solution for the inverse 2D to 3D geometric mapping problem, using the camera projection matrix. The closed-form solution of the mathematical system, along with the initial output of the adapted Faster R-CNN are then passed through a final ShiftNet network that refines the result using our newly proposed Volume Displacement Loss. Our novel, geometrically constrained deep learning approach to monocular 3D object detection obtains top results on KITTI 3D Object Detection Benchmark, being the best among all monocular methods that do not use any pre-trained network for depth estimation. 

027__  Applications in Calibration__arXiv:1905.09939
Author: Hassan Afzal
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09939
 Abstract: Complete and textured 3D reconstruction of dynamic scenes has been facilitated by mapped RGB and depth information acquired by RGB-D cameras based multi-view systems. One of the most critical steps in such multi-view systems is to determine the relative poses of all cameras via a process known as extrinsic calibration. In this work, we propose a sensor fusion framework based on a weighted bi-objective optimization for refinement of extrinsic calibration tailored for RGB-D multi-view systems. The weighted bi-objective cost function, which makes use of 2D information from RGB images and 3D information from depth images, is analytically derived via the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method. The weighting factor appears as a function of noise in 2D and 3D measurements and takes into account the affect of residual errors on the optimization. We propose an iterative scheme to estimate noise variances in 2D and 3D measurements, for simultaneously computing the weighting factor together with the camera poses. An extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the proposed approach shows improved calibration performance as compared to refinement schemes which use only 2D or 3D measurement information. 

028__ Precipitation Nowcasting with Satellite Imagery__arXiv:1905.09932
Author: Vadim Lebedev
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09932
 Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting is a short-range forecast of rain/snow (up to 2 hours), often displayed on top of the geographical map by the weather service. Modern precipitation nowcasting algorithms rely on the extrapolation of observations by ground-based radars via optical flow techniques or neural network models. Dependent on these radars, typical nowcasting is limited to the regions around their locations. We have developed a method for precipitation nowcasting based on geostationary satellite imagery and incorporated the resulting data into the Yandex.Weather precipitation map (including an alerting service with push notifications for products in the Yandex ecosystem), thus expanding its coverage and paving the way to a truly global nowcasting service. 

029__ Multi-level Texture Encoding and Representation (MuLTER) based on Deep  Neural Networks__arXiv:1905.09907
Author: Yuting Hu
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09907
 Abstract: In this paper, we propose a multi-level texture encoding and representation network (MuLTER) for texture-related applications. Based on a multi-level pooling architecture, the MuLTER network simultaneously leverages low- and high-level features to maintain both texture details and spatial information. Such a pooling architecture involves few extra parameters and keeps feature dimensions fixed despite of the changes of image sizes. In comparison with state-of-the-art texture descriptors, the MuLTER network yields higher recognition accuracy on typical texture datasets such as MINC-2500 and GTOS-mobile with a discriminative and compact representation. In addition, we analyze the impact of combining features from different levels, which supports our claim that the fusion of multi-level features efficiently enhances recognition performance.

030__ Adding Intuitive Physics to Neural-Symbolic Capsules Using Interaction  Networks__arXiv:1905.09891
Author: Michael Kissner
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09891
 Abstract: Many current methods to learn intuitive physics are based on interaction networks and similar approaches. However, they rely on information that has proven difficult to estimate directly from image data in the past. We aim to narrow this gap by inferring all the semantic information needed from raw pixel data in the form of a scene-graph. Our approach is based on neural-symbolic capsules, which identify which objects in the scene are static, dynamic, elastic or rigid, possible joints between them, as well as their collision information. By integrating all this with interaction networks, we demonstrate how our method is able to learn intuitive physics directly from image sequences and apply its knowledge to new scenes and objects, resulting in an inverse-simulation pipeline. 

031__ Plane-Based Optimization of Geometry and Texture for RGB-D  Reconstruction of Indoor Scenes__arXiv:1905.09829
Author: Chao Wang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09829
 Abstract: We present a novel approach to reconstruct RGB-D indoor scene with plane primitives. Our approach takes as input a RGB-D sequence and a dense coarse mesh reconstructed by some 3D reconstruction method on the sequence, and generate a lightweight, low-polygonal mesh with clear face textures and sharp features without losing geometry details from the original scene. To achieve this, we firstly partition the input mesh with plane primitives, simplify it into a lightweight mesh next, then optimize plane parameters, camera poses and texture colors to maximize the photometric consistency across frames, and finally optimize mesh geometry to maximize consistency between geometry and planes. Compared to existing planar reconstruction methods which only cover large planar regions in the scene, our method builds the entire scene by adaptive planes without losing geometry details and preserves sharp features in the final mesh. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it onto several RGB-D scans and comparing it to other state-of-the-art reconstruction methods. 

032__ Spatially Coherent Randomized Attention Maps__arXiv:1905.10308
Author: Dan A. Calian
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10308
 Abstract: Attention mechanisms and non-local mean operations in general are key ingredients in many state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. In particular, the Transformer model based on multi-head self-attention has recently achieved great success in natural language processing and computer vision. However, the vanilla algorithm computing the Transformer of an image with n pixels has O(n^2) complexity, which is often painfully slow and sometimes prohibitively expensive for large-scale image data. In this paper, we propose a fast randomized algorithm --- SCRAM --- that only requires O(n log(n)) time to produce an image attention map. Such a dramatic acceleration is attributed to our insight that attention maps on real-world images usually exhibit (1) spatial coherence and (2) sparse structure. The central idea of SCRAM is to employ PatchMatch, a randomized correspondence algorithm, to quickly pinpoint the most compatible key (argmax) for each query first, and then exploit that knowledge to design a sparse approximation to non-local mean operations. Using the argmax (mode) to dynamically construct the sparse approximation distinguishes our algorithm from all of the existing sparse approximate methods and makes it very efficient. Moreover, SCRAM is a broadly applicable approximation to any non-local mean layer in contrast to some other sparse approximations that can only approximate self-attention. Our preliminary experimental results suggest that SCRAM is indeed promising for speeding up or scaling up the computation of attention maps in the Transformer. 

033__ A Research and Strategy of Remote Sensing Image Denoising Algorithms__arXiv:1905.10236
Author: Ling Li
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10236
 Abstract: Most raw data download from satellites are useless, resulting in transmission waste, one solution is to process data directly on satellites, then only transmit the processed results to the ground. Image processing is the main data processing on satellites, in this paper, we focus on image denoising which is the basic image processing. There are many high-performance denoising approaches at present, however, most of them rely on advanced computing resources or rich images on the ground. Considering the limited computing resources of satellites and the characteristics of remote sensing images, we do some research on these high-performance ground image denoising approaches and compare them in simulation experiments to analyze whether they are suitable for satellites. According to the analysis results, we propose two feasible image denoising strategies for satellites based on satellite TianZhi-1. 

034__ Automatic  Quantification of Kidney Function in DCE-MRI Images__arXiv:1905.10218
Author: Santosh Tirunagari
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10218
 Abstract: Quantification of kidney function in Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) requires careful segmentation of the renal region of interest (ROI). Traditionally, human experts are required to manually delineate the kidney ROI across multiple images in the dynamic sequence. This approach is costly, time-consuming and labour intensive, and therefore acts to limit patient throughout and acts as one of the factors limiting the wider adoption of DCR-MRI in clinical practice. Therefore, to address this issue, we present the first use of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) as a basis for automatic segmentation of a dynamic sequence, in this case, kidney ROIs in DCE-MRI. Using DMD coupled combined with thresholding and connected component analysis is first validated on synthetically generated data with known ground-truth, and then applied to ten healthy volunteers' DCE-MRI datasets. We find that the segmentation result obtained from our proposed DMD framework is comparable to that of expert observers and very significantly better than that of an a-priori bounding box segmentation. Our result gives a mean Jaccard coefficient of 0.87, compared to mean scores of 0.85, 0.88 and 0.87 produced from three independent manual annotations. This represents the first use of DMD as a robust automatic data-driven segmentation approach without requiring any human intervention. This is a viable, efficient alternative approach to current manual methods of isolation of kidney function in DCE-MRI. 

035__ Optimizing Shallow Networks for Binary Classification__arXiv:1905.10161
Author: Kalliopi Basioti
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10161
 Abstract: Data driven classification that relies on neural networks is based on optimization criteria that involve some form of distance between the output of the network and the desired label. Using the same mathematical mathematical analysis, for a multitude of such measures, we can show that their optimum solution matches the ideal likelihood ratio test classifier. In this work we introduce a different family of optimization problems which is not covered by the existing approaches and, therefore, opens possibilities for new training algorithms for neural network based classification. We give examples that lead to algorithms that are simple in implementation, exhibit stable convergence characteristics and are antagonistic to the most popular existing techniques. 

036__ Continual Reinforcement Learning in 3D Non-stationary Environments__arXiv:1905.10112
Author: Vincenzo Lomonaco
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10112
 Abstract: High-dimensional always-changing environments constitute a hard challenge for current reinforcement learning techniques. Artificial agents, nowadays, are often trained off-line in very static and controlled conditions in simulation such that training observations can be thought as sampled i.i.d. from the entire observations space. However, in real world settings, the environment is often non-stationary and subject to unpredictable, frequent changes. In this paper we propose and openly release CRLMaze, a new benchmark for learning continually through reinforcement in a complex 3D non-stationary task based on ViZDoom and subject to several environmental changes. Then, we introduce an end-to-end model-free continual reinforcement learning strategy showing competitive results with respect to four different baselines and not requiring any access to additional supervised signals, previously encountered environmental conditions or observations. 

037__ Exploration via Flow-Based Intrinsic Rewards__arXiv:1905.10071
Author: Hsuan-Kung Yang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10071
 Abstract: Exploration bonuses derived from the novelty of observations in an environment have become a popular approach to motivate exploration for reinforcement learning (RL) agents in the past few years. Recent methods such as curiosity-driven exploration usually estimate the novelty of new observations by the prediction errors of their system dynamics models. In this paper, we introduce the concept of optical flow estimation from the field of computer vision to the RL domain and utilize the errors from optical flow estimation to evaluate the novelty of new observations. We introduce a flow-based intrinsic curiosity module (FICM) capable of learning the motion features and understanding the observations in a more comprehensive and efficient fashion. We evaluate our method and compare it with a number of baselines on several benchmark environments, including Atari games, Super Mario Bros., and ViZDoom. Our results show that the proposed method is superior to the baselines in certain environments, especially for those featuring sophisticated moving patterns or with high-dimensional observation spaces. We further analyze the hyper-parameters used in the training phase and discuss our insights into them. 

038__ Perception Evaluation -- A new solar image quality metric based on the  multi-fractal property of texture features__arXiv:1905.09980
Author: Yi Huang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09980
 Abstract: Next-generation ground-based solar observations require good image quality metrics for post-facto processing techniques. Based on the assumption that texture features in solar images are multi-fractal which can be extracted by a trained deep neural network as feature maps, a new reduced-reference objective image quality metric, the perception evaluation is proposed. The perception evaluation is defined as cosine distance of Gram matrix between feature maps extracted from high resolution reference image and that from blurred images. We evaluate performance of the perception evaluation with simulated and real observation images. The results show that with a high resolution image as reference, the perception evaluation can give robust estimate of image quality for solar images of different scenes.

 Abstract: Image retrieval is an important problem in the area of multimedia processing. This paper presents two new curvelet-based algorithms for texture retrieval which are suitable for use in constrained-memory devices. The developed algorithms are tested on three publicly available texture datasets: CUReT, Mondial-Marmi, and STex-fabric. Our experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed system. Furthermore, a weighted version of the proposed retrieval algorithm is proposed, which is shown to achieve promising results in the classification of seismic activities. 

040__ Improving Prognostic Value of CT Deep Radiomic Features in Pancreatic  Ductal Adenocarcinoma Using Transfer Learning__arXiv:1905.09888
Author: Yucheng Zhang
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09888
 Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive cancers with an extremely poor prognosis. Radiomics has shown prognostic ability in multiple types of cancer including PDAC. However, the prognostic value of traditional radiomics pipelines, which are based on hand-crafted radiomic features alone, is limited due to multicollinearity of features and multiple testing problem, and limited performance of conventional machine learning classifiers. Deep learning architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been shown to outperform traditional techniques in computer vision tasks, such as object detection. However, they require large sample sizes for training which limits their development. As an alternative solution, CNN-based transfer learning has shown the potential for achieving reasonable performance using datasets with small sample sizes. In this work, we developed a CNN-based transfer learning approach for prognostication in PDAC patients for overall survival. The results showed that transfer learning approach outperformed the traditional radiomics model on PDAC data. A transfer learning approach may fill the gap between radiomics and deep learning analytics for cancer prognosis and improve performance beyond what CNNs can achieve using small datasets. 

041__ Thwarting finite difference adversarial attacks with output  randomization__arXiv:1905.09871
Author: Haidar Khan
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09871
 Abstract: Adversarial examples pose a threat to deep neural network models in a variety of scenarios, from settings where the adversary has complete knowledge of the model and to the opposite "black box" setting. Black box attacks are particularly threatening as the adversary only needs access to the input and output of the model. Defending against black box adversarial example generation attacks is paramount as currently proposed defenses are not effective. Since these types of attacks rely on repeated queries to the model to estimate gradients over input dimensions, we investigate the use of randomization to thwart such adversaries from successfully creating adversarial examples. Randomization applied to the output of the deep neural network model has the potential to confuse potential attackers, however this introduces a tradeoff between accuracy and robustness. We show that for certain types of randomization, we can bound the probability of introducing errors by carefully setting distributional parameters. For the particular case of finite difference black box attacks, we quantify the error introduced by the defense in the finite difference estimate of the gradient. Lastly, we show empirically that the defense can thwart two adaptive black box adversarial attack algorithms. error here, check on website.

043__ A Deep Learning Based Model For Cross-Modal Retrieval In  Remote Sensing__arXiv:1904.04794
Author: Ushasi Chaudhuri
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1904.04794
 Abstract: We address the problem of cross-modal information retrieval in the domain of remote sensing. In particular, we are interested in two application scenarios: i) cross-modal retrieval between panchromatic (PAN) and multi-spectral imagery, and ii) multi-label image retrieval between very high resolution (VHR) images and speech based label annotations. Notice that these multi-modal retrieval scenarios are more challenging than the traditional uni-modal retrieval approaches given the inherent differences in distributions between the modalities. However, with the growing availability of multi-source remote sensing data and the scarcity of enough semantic annotations, the task of multi-modal retrieval has recently become extremely important. In this regard, we propose a novel deep neural network based architecture which is considered to learn a discriminative shared feature space for all the input modalities, suitable for semantically coherent information retrieval. Extensive experiments are carried out on the benchmark large-scale PAN - multi-spectral DSRSID dataset and the multi-label UC-Merced dataset. Together with the Merced dataset, we generate a corpus of speech signals corresponding to the labels. Superior performance with respect to the current state-of-the-art is observed in all the cases. 

044__ A fast DNN optimization method based on curvature information__arXiv:1903.11991
Author: Maximus Mutschler
PDF:http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1903.11991
 Abstract: We present a novel optimizer for deep neural networks that combines the ideas of Netwon's method and line search to efficiently compute and utilize curvature information. Our work is based on empirical observation suggesting that the loss function can be approximated by a parabola in negative gradient direction. Due to this approximation, we are able to perform a variable and loss function dependent parameter update by jumping directly into the minimum of the approximated parabola. To evaluate our optimizer, we performed multiple comprehensive hyperparameter grid searches for which we trained more than 20000 networks in total. We can show that PAL outperforms RMSPROP, and can outperform gradient descent with momentum and ADAM on large-scale high-dimensional machine learning problems. Furthermore, PAL requires up to 52.2% less training epochs. PyTorch and TensorFlow implementations are provided at this https URL
